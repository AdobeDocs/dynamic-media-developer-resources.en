# ICC profile map reference{#icc-profile-map-reference}

If an ICC profile map is required for an image catalog, the relative or absolute path of the profile map file must be specified in attribute::IccProfileMapFile.

Entries in the ICC profile map of a specific image catalog override entries in the ICC profile map of the default catalog.

Image Serving supports color profile files that satisfy the ICC Specification.
