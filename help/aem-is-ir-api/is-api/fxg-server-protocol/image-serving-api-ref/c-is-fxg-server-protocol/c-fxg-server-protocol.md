# FXG server protocol{#fxg-server-protocol}

To manipulate a graphic, you can use reference points similar to compass points.

Using reference points, you can rotate, scale, or resize a graphic relative to a particular reference point. The reference points are `northWest`, `north`, `northEast`, `west`, `center`, `east`, `southWest`, `south`, and `southeast`. For example, by using the center reference point, you can rotate a graphic by 45 degrees on its center. This illustration shows where the reference points are located, a graphic, the graphic rotated 20 degrees from its `northWest` reference point, and the graphic rotated 20 degrees from its `east` reference point.

* A. Reference point locations 
* B. A graphic 
* C. The graphic rotated 20 degrees from its `northWest` reference point 
* D. The graphic rotated 20 degrees from its `east` reference point

The syntax is:

`referencePoint <string> (northWest, north, northEast, west, center, east, southWest, south, southEast, none, inherit)`

The default value is none. The `inherit` value passes the `s7:referencePoint` value, provided it is not `none`, from the top of the page or group level to all children. The `none` setting means that there is no reference point for the object and the FXG coordinate system is used.

>To use a reference point and not have any displacement in the object after it is manipulated, update the x and y values of the object after you manipulate it.

When a value from `s7:referencePoint` is used with groups (or paths, line elements, or any element that doesnâ€™t have explicit width and height definitions), the value applies to the cumulative bounding box of the group. For example, the top-left point of the bounding box of all the objects in the group serves as the `northWest` reference point for the group; the bottom-right point serves as the `southEast` reference point.
