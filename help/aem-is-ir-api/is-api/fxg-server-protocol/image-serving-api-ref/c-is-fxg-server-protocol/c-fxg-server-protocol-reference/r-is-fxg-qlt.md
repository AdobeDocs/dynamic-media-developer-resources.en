Used only if `fmt=jpg`. Ignored otherwise

Higher quality values increase file size and quality, lower values decrease file sizes and reduce perceived image quality. Values above 90 often generate images indistinguishable from the uncompressed image.

Set the `chroma` flag to disable the RGB chromaticity down-sampling employed by typical JPEG encoders. This may increase the perceived sharpness of edges in an image when the edge is defined by a change in hue rather than brightness. Setting this flag may cause a slight increase in file size. Experiment with this setting if text seems slightly blurry.

`chroma` is ignored if the output pixel type is CMYK or gray.
