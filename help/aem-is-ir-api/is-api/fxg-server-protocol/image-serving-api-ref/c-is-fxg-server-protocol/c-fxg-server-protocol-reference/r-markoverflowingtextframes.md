# markOverflowingTextFrames{#markoverflowingtextframes}

Display overset text frames with plus sign. A text overflow indicator shows when text exceeds the space allocated for it in a text frame (or in the last text frame in the case of threaded text). The indicator is a red box with a plus sign in it.

<table id="simpletable_F17FD29EB52043BF9000923ED5195A26"> 
 <tr class="strow"> 
  <td class="stentry"> <p><span class="codeph"> &amp;markOverflowingTextFrames</span> </p> </td> 
  <td class="stentry"> <p>0|1 </p></td> 
 </tr> 
</table>

Setting modifier `markOverflowingTextFrames=1` through a URL call marks all the text frames where text is overset with a plus sign. Also, in Dynamic Media Classic previewer, the text overset indicator is set to " `TRUE`" by default.

Default is 0.
