Image (default). Requests standard image data.

 `req=img`

The reply data format and response MIME type are determined by `fmt=`. `req=img` is the default request type and does not need to be specified explicitly. The HTTP response is cacheable with the TTL based on `catalog::Expiration`.

Other request commands are applied as documented.
