## Properties {#section-a171bacf4ddf43c782e46b86a16d443e}

Request attribute. Applies to all scaling operations involved in creating the final reply image, including all layer scaling.

## Default {#section-d5e1b26f5703461395018a3a627f7283}

`attribute::ResMode`

## Example {#section-ee8c3e5a2e3845fe81de5073a8ab7efe}

Retrieve a best-quality rendition of a layered image stored in an image catalog. The image might include text. We expect to further process in an image editing application, and thus request an alpha-channel with the image.
