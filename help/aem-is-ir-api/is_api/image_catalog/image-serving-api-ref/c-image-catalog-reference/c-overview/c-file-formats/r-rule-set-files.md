# Rule set files{#rule-set-files}

Rule set files are XML-formatted text files and must adhere to the appropriate standards and conventions.

 [!DNL RuleSet.xsd] is installed in the default catalog folder and should be used to validate rule set files before submitting them to Image Serving. Strict parsing is applied and rule set files that do not conform to [!DNL RuleSet.xsd] do not load.
