# Image/SVG data reference{#image-svg-data-reference}

Even though image and SVG data are very similar, they are maintained in separate tables in the image catalog.

 If image data is required, the relative or absolute path of the image data files that itemize the images must be specified in `attribute::CatalogFile`. If SVG data is required, the relative or absolute path of the SVG data files must be specified in `attribute::SvgCatalogFile`.
