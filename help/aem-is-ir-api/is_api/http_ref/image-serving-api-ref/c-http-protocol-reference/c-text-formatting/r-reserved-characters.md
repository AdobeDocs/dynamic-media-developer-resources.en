# Reserved characters{#reserved-characters}

This section lists characters that are reserved for specific purposes.

RTF uses curly braces ' `{`' and ' `}`' as group delimiters. They must occur in pairs and may be nested. To display curly braces in text strings, use ' `\{`' and ' `\}`', respectively.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You must URL-encode all curly braces used in RTF.

Back slashes '\' are used to introduce RTF commands and keywords. To display a backslash, use `'\\'`.
