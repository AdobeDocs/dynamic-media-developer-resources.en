# Image Server log{#image-server-log}

The Image Server writes records to this log file to record warnings and errors and keep a record of startup and shutdown events.

In addition, the Image Server log can be configured to keep track of substantial additional detail, such as image file accesses, to help debug server problems.

The Image Server log is configured in [!DNL ImageServerRegistry.xml].
