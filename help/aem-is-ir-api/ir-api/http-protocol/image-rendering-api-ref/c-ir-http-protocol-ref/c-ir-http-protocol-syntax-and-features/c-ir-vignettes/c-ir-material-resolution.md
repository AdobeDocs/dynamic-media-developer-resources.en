# Material resolution{#material-resolution}

The resolution value of a repeatable texture or other material defines the size of the material image in the scene coordinate space.

Texture resolution values are specified in pixels per inch (or whichever units the vignette dictates for its scene coordinate space).

The material resolution is specified with `res=`.
