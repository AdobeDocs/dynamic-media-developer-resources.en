# Variable processing in embedded foreign requests{#variable-processing-in-embedded-foreign-requests}

$var$ references occurring anywhere within the curly braces of an embedded foreign request are substituted with matching variable definition values.

This allows embedded foreign requests to be placed in a template in an image catalog.

Variable values which are to be substituted into foreign requests typically must be double-encoded, since no re-encoding is applied before the server attempts to transmit the final foreign url.
