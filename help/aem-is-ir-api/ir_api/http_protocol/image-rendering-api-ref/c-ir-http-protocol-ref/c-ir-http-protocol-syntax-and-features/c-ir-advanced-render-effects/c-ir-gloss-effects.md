# Gloss effects{#gloss-effects}

If so enabled in the vignette, the renderer will vary the illumination algorithm to simulate a variation of the material glossiness (chiefly by controlling contrast).

This effect is independent of reflection rendering, and complements it by simulating specular reflections. The effect is controlled with the same `gloss=`, `glossmap=`, and `type=` attributes that are used to control reflections.
