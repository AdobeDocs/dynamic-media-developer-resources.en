To use Image Serving, a Scene7 Image Serving license key is required and must be installed on each system on which Image Serving is to be used.

Similarly, to use Image Rendering, a Scene7 Image Rendering license key is required. Image Rendering can be used without an Image Serving license, and vice versa.

The installation procedure includes steps to obtain and install the necessary license keys.
