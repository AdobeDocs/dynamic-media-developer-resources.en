# Installation of Image Serving {#installation}

Installing Image Serving includes two major server components: 

* Image Server. A stand-alone, native-code executable.
* [!DNL Platform Server]. A stand-alone Java™ web application and application server.

Image Rendering is a part of these two server components.

In the subsequent instructions, `install_root` refers to the root folder in which Image Serving and Image Rendering are installed. And `server:port` refers to the host name or IP address and port number configured as the main listening port for the [!DNL Platform Server].
