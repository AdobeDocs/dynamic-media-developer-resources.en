You must install Image Serving before you can use it.

Image Serving includes of two major components: the Image Server, which is a stand-alone, native-code executable, and the Platform Server, which is a stand-alone Java web application and application server. Image Rendering is a part of these server components.

In the subsequent instructions, `install_root` refers to the root folder in which Image Serving and Image Rendering are installed, and `server:port` refers to the host name or IP address and port number configured as the main listening port for the Platform Server.
