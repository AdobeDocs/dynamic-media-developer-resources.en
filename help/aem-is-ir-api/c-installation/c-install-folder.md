# Install folder{#install-folder}

The Image Serving install folder (install_folder) is install_root/ImageServing.

 *[!DNL install_root]* defaults to `C:\Program Files\Scene7` on Windows (a different *[!DNL install_root]* folder may be selected during installation). On Linux, *[!DNL install_root]* must always be [!DNL /usr/local/scene7] (symbolic links may be used).

In this document, *[!DNL install_folder]* may be represented by ' [!DNL ./]'.

All file paths are case-sensitive on UNIX and case-insensitive on Windows.
