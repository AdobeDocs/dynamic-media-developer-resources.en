# Starting or stopping on Linux{#starting-or-stopping-on-linux}

There are two options for starting or stopping Image Serving on Linux.

* The script to start, stop, and verify status of Image Serving is located in the [!DNL ImageServing/bin] folder:

  `ImageServing.sh {start|stop|restart|status}` 
* The following alternative should be familiar to system administrators:

  `/sbin/service ImageServing {start|stop|status}`
