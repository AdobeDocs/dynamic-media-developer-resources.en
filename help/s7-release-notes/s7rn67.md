[Adding captions to eVideo](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/scene7/using/WS98ca2e6790647c06-6f6f53e137b959f094-8000.html). --> 
**Metadata**

* Improved performance when searching metadata in SPS

  In **Personal Setup**, in the **Browser** group, the option **Include UDF's (User-Defined Fields) in Search** is now deselected (off) by default for all user accounts to improve system performance for most metadata searches that you run.

<!--   [Personal Setup](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/scene7/using/WSCAAE9C8A-F172-43a8-B134-6163E7C80218.html). -->

  If most of your metadata searches benefit from including user-defined fields, you can select this option to turn it on. As an alternative, use **Advanced Search** to allow for a more directed and faster search than including all user-defined fields.

<!--   [Advanced search](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/scene7/using/WS259993e42159a215-1c6a66df1265272619e-7ff5.html). -->

**eVideo**

* Added closed captioning support to the new **Universal_HTML5_Video_Social** viewer, by way of WebVTT files.

<!--   [Adding captions to eVideo](http://help.stage.adobe.com/en_US/scene7/using/WS98ca2e6790647c06-6f6f53e137b959f094-8000.html). --> 

* Primary source Video is now excluded from any Adaptive Video Set.

  Previously, the primary MP4 or F4V source file was automatically added to the system-generated Adaptive Video Set. As a result, these large primary source files sometimes caused video playback problems. Now, when you apply a series of encoding presets to the primary video, you can expect to see an Adaptive Video Set without the primary source file. 

* New **Adaptive Video Encoding (16:9 or 4:3)**.

  This new option combines all five 16:9 Adaptive Video encoding presets and all five 4:3 Adaptive Video encoding presets into one primary encoding preset list. When you upload your video using this new option, it automatically applies the correct encoding presets to match the aspect ratio of your source video. (This setting replaced the previous Adaptive Video encoding presets.)
