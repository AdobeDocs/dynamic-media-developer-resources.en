**Features no longer supported**

* Catalog Server Resync option within the IPS Classic Publish Validate - removed. 
* You can no longer set empty or duplicate metadata tag field values.

**Bug fixes**

* PDFfiles were getting logged as published twice per publish server when early published on upload. 
* Uploading multiple PSD files with the same layers names led to optimization errors. 
* PDFL Rasterization of customer PDF resulted in an unexpected white line in the generated image. 
* Video thumbnail files were published multiple times on upload. 
* Duplicate upload file detection generated two upload notifications, throwing off the completed file accounting. 
* Sidecar XML file for video transcode was logged as published multiple times on update.

**New features, enhancements, and bug fixes for Dynamic Media Image Serving Viewers 5.2.2**

Viewer upgrades are backwards compatibleâ€”no changes are necessary to your existing web code. However, it is recommended that you test the new viewers on our staging environment. The following website gives instructions on how you can set up your system to access our staging server:

[http://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/scene7/kb/base/upgrade-management/testing-scene7-viewers-upgrade.html](http://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/scene7/kb/base/upgrade-management/testing-scene7-viewers-upgrade.html)

After you have set up your computer to access the staging server, you can check your website to test the upgrade. If you are using out-of-the-box HTML5 viewers, the best practice is for you to test against our standard staging server and s7is5-preview-staging.scene7.com.

## Features no longer supported {#section-9295ea9313c84695b19bca0e0f01a690}

* **Flash Viewers End-of-Life Notice** *Effective January 31, 2017, Adobe Scene7 (now Dynamic Media Classic) officially ended support for the Flash viewer platform.*

* Reminder: As of January 31, 2014, Scene7 officially ended support for the DHTML viewer platform.

  For more information about this change, see the following FAQ website:

  [http://dev.day.com/content/docs/en/cq/current/administering/integrating_with_omniture/scene7/dhtml-viewer-endoflifefaqs.html](http://dev.day.com/content/docs/en/cq/current/administering/integrating_with_omniture/scene7/dhtml-viewer-endoflifefaqs.html) 

* Scene7 Creative Suite Extensions are deprecated in this release due to the Creative Cloud Application's de-support of Flash panels. Further development of content ingestion workflows are focusing on Adobe Experience Manager Dynamic Media and Creative Cloud. For Scene7, upload and export capabilities in the Scene7 Publishing System remain and can be used instead. 
* UGC Video is deprecated in this release due to low adoption. Setting up another Dynamic Media Classic account can serve as a replacement solution for UGC Video. Contact Adobe Technical Support to have another account set up. 
* Text hyphenation is deprecated in this release due to low adoption. The hyphenation dictionaries defined how words could be split and hyphenated to support optimal text flow. 
* Metadata Server and Similarity Search were both deprecated in 2015 due to low adoption. When the official deprecation target date is announced, affected customers will be notified by Adobe Technical Support.
