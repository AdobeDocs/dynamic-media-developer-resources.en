**Media Portal**

* Export large files without experiencing timeouts.

* Metadata schemas

  Metadata schemas define sets of metadata properties. Each property of the Metadata schema has a basic data type like String, Float, Integer, Date or Yes/No. Also lists, open choices or closed choices can be defined. Metadata schemas can be used in all metadata workflows like search, edit, import, metadata views and metadata presets. <!-- [More information](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/scene7/using/WS259993e42159a215-1c6a66df1265272619e-7fec.html#WSd968ca97bf03cf72-5e3dd3a113268dc80f5-8000). -->

  Metadata schemas are the successor technology for UDFs and are intended for customized metadata workflows especially in the context of the Metadata Server. 

* Metadata Server

  >[!NOTE]
  >
  >Metadata Server will be available starting in May. It must be enabled by support. Metadata Server is currently available only in North America and Europe.

* The metadata Server exposes a subset of all metadata fields of an asset to a public-facing server and can be requested here by eCom pages or servers. This exposed metadata could a mix set of Asset Properties, UDFs, XMP and Metadata Schema properties. The Metadata Server offers a WEB-API with a variety of search capabilities like searches for metadata, or image similiarity, or both. For each returned asset a list of metadata properties is requested. <!-- [More information](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/scene7/using/WS1ffbb36e209a6fc9-44279087131d3ad5622-8000.html). -->
* Metadata import can handle XMP properties

  The metadata import is extended to handle XMP properties and properties, defined in Metadata schemas. 
* Metadata View to display only fields containing values

  There is a new predefined Metadata View called "All Properties with Values" that only shows meta properties that contain values. Properties (from XMP, User-Defined Fields or the new Metadata Schemas) without values are hidden and will not show up.
* Metadata settings now grouped in the administration user interface.

  In **[!UICONTROL Setup > Application Setup]**, metadata-related setting pages are now grouped in a top-level section called [!DNL Metadata]. Here you find the setting pages for Metadata View, Metadata Presets, Metadata Schema and the User-Defined Fields.

This desktop application lets you import existing 3D models and author them as 2D vignette files. The resulting vignette files can be uploaded to SPS, where colors and textures can be replaced on-demand.

## Software Fixes {#section-4219d5dd0a024cd3a95aaac45598363c}

The following issues have been fixed in Metadata Server:

* Solved an issue that caused uploads of very large EPS files to fail. 
* "Metadata searches" with long result list silently fail. This issue causes wrong search results to be displayed.
