# Gather Image and Data{#gather-image-and-data}

The first step in creating a script is to gather the images and data needed for the script.

A script needs two things:

* To locate the images required to build the vignette 
* The additional data required to build the objects and object hierarchy in the vignette

For example, a script could locate images by traversing a directory structure while the extra data is loaded from a CSV file (potentially converted from an Excel workbook) or an XML file.

Important considerations:

* All images added to a vignette must match the size of the view image. 
* To ensure that images display as expected, add objects back to front.
