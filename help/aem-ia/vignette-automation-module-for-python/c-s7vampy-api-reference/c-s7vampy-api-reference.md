# s7vampy API Reference{#s-vampy-api-reference}

The s7vampy module is internally built of several sub-modules that separate out functionality.

 Normally, a script that uses s7vampy does not need to access the sub-modules directly, because Python automatically makes classes and functions available. The main functions required can be made available to your script using the *from s7vampy import &#42;* statement.
