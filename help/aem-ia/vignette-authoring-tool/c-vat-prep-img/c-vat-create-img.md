# Creating an Image to Work With{#creating-an-image-to-work-with}

Before you process an image with Image Authoring, you must prepare the image for your vignette.

The original image can be a scanned photograph or transparency, or an image from a high-quality digital camera. From the original image, you create a view image to work with in [!DNL Image Authoring].

With a third-party graphics tool such as [!DNL Photoshop], you can [adjust the image](../c-vat-gs/c-vat-work-ps/t-vat-prep-img-ps.md#task-f796b659745740028b561d61ab9823ea).
