# Creating Optimal Images{#creating-optimal-images}

When creating or modifying an image for use in [!DNL Image Authoring], consider the following:

* Photograph your products in neutral, non-patterned colors when possible. 
* Scan the photos and/or scale your source images to a screen resolution equal to or higher than the required resolution for the authored target image. You can scale the image to its final size in [!DNL Image Authoring] after you author it.

If performance is not a problem, author vignettes at 1.5x to 2x the final desired screen resolution. This produces higher-resolution outputs, should you need them in the future. This can improve the authoring quality, especially if the scene includes apparel or drapery objects with detailed folds, wrinkles, or overlaps.

Depending on complexity and expected use, typical image sizes might range from 800 to 2000 pixels in width or height.

* You can [crop](../c-vat-gs/t-vat-crop-vign.md#task-5cc9325e3592489d83109e0cec744bac) the image before or after authoring. If you think you might have to crop the image after authoring, don't crop until authoring is complete. 
* Save your view image as 24-bit RGB in BMP, JPG, PNG, TGA, or TIF format. 
* When creating texture images, make sure you create a [full-tile repeat](../c-vat-troubleshooting/r-vat-full-tile-repeat/r-vat-full-tile-repeat.md#reference-7dc916534a864b2d9a5d21ca31056b54).
