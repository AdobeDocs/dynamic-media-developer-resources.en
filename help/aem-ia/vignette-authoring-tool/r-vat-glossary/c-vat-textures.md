# Textures{#textures}

A texture is a covering of some type (fabric, wallpaper, floor tile, countertop surface) that contains a pattern.

You can determine how a texture will look on an object by using the tools on the [!DNL Flowline] or [!DNL Sketch] page. Use the [!DNL Flowline] page for upholstered furniture and the [!DNL Sketch] page for apparel and linens.

You can use a texture to develop your flowlines, as shown on this seat cushion.
