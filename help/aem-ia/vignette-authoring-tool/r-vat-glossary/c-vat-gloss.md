The gloss value specifies the relative shininess of the material surface.

The gloss value specifies the relative shininess of the material surface. It can be used to control the 3D reflection render effect. Higher gloss values typically cause stronger, sharper reflections. Each material type defines a minimum and a maximum reflection render effect. Gloss is not supported for window coverings or cabinets.

You set the gloss reference values for the vignette in the [ [!DNL View Properties] dialog box](../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-abt-obj-prop/c-vat-view-prop.md#concept-8a396f7b144c46c4806c8ed26619eed1) by choosing gloss values for any of three [!DNL Illumination Maps] and activating or deactivating those maps. You can set gloss for a particular material in the [ [!DNL Material Properties] box](../c-vat-rend-pg/c-vat-work-text/c-vat-text-mat-prop/c-vat-text-mat-prop.md#concept-56e919cfd48748169dc2f011aa95c5fd), and you can control gloss independently for a decal in the [ [!DNL Decal Properties] dialog box](../c-vat-rend-pg/c-vat-rend-obj/c-vat-decals/t-vat-decal-prop.md#task-287527f44dbe405285fb2f55af65107b).
