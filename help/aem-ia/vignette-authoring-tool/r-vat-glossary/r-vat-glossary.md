# Glossary{#glossary}

 **3D Flowline or Sketch Objects:** A 3D objects that sits on a reflective plane in your image, for example, a vase that sits on a flat table, the legs of a chair on a shiny floor, or curtains that are reflected in a shiny floor. You attach these objects to planes and specify where the object meets the plane, so the object appears three-dimensional when you render it. The line also defines where the bottom of the object is, so reflections render accurately.

**Alpha Map:** Displays the reflection strength. Brighter regions have stronger, sharper reflections, while darker regions have weaker, more diffused reflections.

**Authoring:** The process applied to a view image to make it a vignette.

**Camera Target:** The spot at which the camera was pointed when the view image photo was taken for a 3D vignette.

**Flowlines:** Horizontal and vertical lines you manipulate to imitate the folds and creases in an object. The flowlines themselves are not visible in the vignette on your website, but they determine how rendered textures are applied to objects.

**Flowline Mesh:** The box that surrounds the masked area (containing the flowlines) and a pattern within the masked area (the mesh). You manipulate the [!DNL Flowline Mesh] to control the folds and contours of the masked object area. The [!DNL Flowline Mesh] is not visible on the vignette on your website.

**Full Repeat:** The area of fabric space in which an image is able to tile over an infinite amount of space, making it easily replicated in a production line environment.

**Geometry:** Information about the angles and scale of the scene you are modeling.

**Geometry Block:** The rectangular representation of the geometric space in your view image. You use the block to indicate the scale of the image.

**Group:** The top-level tier in the hierarchy of a vignette. A group links a set of sub-groups and/or objects together and can control how the sub-groups and objects are rendered.

**Guidelines:** The lines you use to indicate the height, width, and depth of the scene in your view image.

**Hierarchy:** The organization of parts or objects within a vignette.

**Illumination Maps:** Determines the brightness value for every decoratable object when you render your vignette. The [!DNL Illumination Map] is automatically generated when you create your vignette. You can edit the [!DNL Illumination Map] at any time (before or after objects have been masked) with a third-party graphics tool such as [!DNL Photoshop].

**Mask:** The area that defines the surface for an individual object.

**Object:** The final tier in the hierarchy of a vignette. Objects are individual parts of a vignette. The group and/or sub-group to which an object belongs can control the way the object is rendered.

**Object Explorer:** On the [!DNL Object] page, the area on the right side of the screen that resembles the Windows Explorer. It lists all groups and objects in your vignette, including the view object (the photo your vignette is based on) and the background object.

**Planar Object:** A flat surface, such as a countertop or floor, that doesn't have its own object type. For walls or cabinets, use the object types dedicated to those items. Planar objects accept paint and generic textures-use cabinets to get cabinet textures. You can attach Planar objects to planes so they move and resize together.

**Preview Material:** The texture or pattern used for the [!DNL Flowline Mesh]. Choose a preview material that clearly displays the contours of your changing [!DNL Flowline Mesh] and accentuates potential problem areas as clearly as possible. Stripes or plaids are usually a good choice. If an object uses only one type of texture or pattern (for example, floral patterns), choose a texture representative of this type.

**Preview Texture:** The texture or pattern used for the [!DNL Flowline Mesh]. Choose a preview material that clearly displays the contours of your changing [!DNL Flowline Mesh] and accentuates potential problem areas as clearly as possible. Stripes or plaids are usually a good choice. If an object uses only one type of texture or pattern (for example, floral patterns), choose a texture representative of this type.

**Reflection Map:** Determines how objects in a 3D vignette are reflected by their surrounding objects.

**Rendering:** The ability to apply digital scans of real products (colors or textures) to your products without having to re-photograph them or lose shading and folding when you change the surface for an item.

**Sub-Group:** The second level tier in the hierarchy of a vignette. A sub-group links a series of objects in a vignette and can control how the objects are rendered. A sub-group is the deepest level into which you can organize a group of objects.

**Texture:** Any surface option, other than a solid color. For example, different wallpaper samples are textures for a wall; different upholstery fabrics are textures for furniture.

**View Image:** The starting image, with all color and pattern removed from the areas that are decoratable. You can also remove any texture, so that a smooth surface remains in the areas where rendering occurs. (Leave the texture in the image if it is always part of the product being authored, with only the color changing.)

**Vertexes:** The little blue squares that reshape a mask, [!DNL Flowline Mesh], or image map.

**Vignette:** A digital image that has been authored to accept texture change-outs to create a photo-realistic model of every surface area, including complex curved and folded surfaces that retain their reflectance and radiance properties.
