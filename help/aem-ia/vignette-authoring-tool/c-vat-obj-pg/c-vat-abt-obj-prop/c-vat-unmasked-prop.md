# Unmasked Properties{#unmasked-properties}

To see the Object Properties dialog box for the unmasked area of your vignette, right-click Unmasked in the Object Explorer and choose Properties.

For vignettes created in earlier versions of [!DNL Image Authoring], the [!DNL Unmasked] area is called the [!DNL Background]. These vignettes may display an [!DNL Ident] value. This is the object type for the [!DNL Background] you provided when you created the view.

The [!DNL Object Properties] dialog box for the unmasked area has these tabs:

## General {#section-d4649a9762dd41b6992c3284f04f5c8e}

**Name:** The name you provided for the unmasked area when you created the view. You can change this at any time.

## Mask {#section-3ee4a9dcdf2840049b358f921e27baa5}

** Offset:** The x,y values for the top left corner of the bounding rectangle of the unmasked area relative to the top left corner of the image. If you haven't defined a mask for this area, the values for the mask offset are the full width of the vignette.

**Show:** Creates a view of the mask for this object in a separate window. You can save this view at its actual size using the [!DNL Save As] command. This is a read-only view, so you can't edit it.

** Export:** Saves the mask image at the same size as the full image, filling in the area around the mask with black. You can export in [!DNL .PNG] format only.
