# General tab for objects{#general-tab-for-objects}

 **Name** 
 The name you provided for the object when you created it. You can change this at any time.

**No Texture** 
Force objects that normally accept textures to accept solid colors only. For 3D vignettes, [reflection](../../../../c-vat-refl-pg/c-vat-abt-refl-pg/c-vat-abt-refl-pg.md#concept-ff491f2f926e4389afac1d2e261b2e81) is supported. This option does not appear for either non-texturable objects or matte highlight objects.

Vignettes created with earlier versions of [!DNL Image Authoring] may display an [!DNL Ident] field. This is the object type for the object you provided when you created it. You can change this at any time. All objects within the same group should use that group's [!DNL Ident] value.
