# Extrusion tab for objects{#extrusion-tab-for-objects}

 **Origin and Normal:** Define the 3D base plane for the extrusion object, typically the reflection plane. These values are typically set using the [!DNL 3D Import] tool on the [!DNL Object] page or the [!DNL Copy From] button.

**Copy From:** Copies the plane definition from another object to use as the reflection plane.

**Plane and Extrusion Curve are Valid:** This box is checked if you assigned a valid reflection plane and [defined the extrusion intersection curve using the [!DNL Edit Model] tool](../../../../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-obj-pg-tools/c-vat-edit-mod-tool/c-vat-edit-mod-tool.md#concept-1f0094296702446bbf2fa360abae7c8d).
