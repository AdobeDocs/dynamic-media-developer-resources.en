# Panels tab for objects{#panels-tab-for-objects}

This tab displays information about the cabinet layout you created for this object.

 **Index:** Which panel (of all the panels in the vignette) this one is. Choose a different index number to see information about that panel.

**Type:** Choose one of the panel types in the drop-down list.

**Left, Right, Top, Bottom:** The position, relative to the texture origin, of each of these locations.

You can customize the names for door and cabinet panels by editing the [!DNL vat.ini] file. Look for the areas near the end of the file labeled [cabinet panels] and [door panels]. Replace the names shown with the ones you want. The new names appear wherever cabinet names are displayed in [!DNL Image Authoring] and the [!DNL Cabinet Authoring] tool.
