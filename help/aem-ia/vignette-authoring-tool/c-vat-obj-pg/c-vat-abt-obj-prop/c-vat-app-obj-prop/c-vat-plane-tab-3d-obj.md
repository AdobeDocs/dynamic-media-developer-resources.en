# Plane Tab for 3D Objects{#plane-tab-for-d-objects}

This tab displays the properties of the 3D plane attached to this object, as generated on the 3D Modeling page.

 **Plane Origin and Plane Normal:** These fields define the plane in three dimensions, using world coordinates (usually inches).

**Texture Origin:** The three-dimensional location of the [texture origin](../../../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-abt-obj-prop/c-vat-3d-obj-prop/c-vat-3d-flow-obj-prop/c-vat-text-tab-obj.md#concept-81d47c5bdaf64427a222acfee3e6d557).

**Texture Direction:** Defines the principal texture direction as a 3D vector. When rendering, the texture is oriented so that its top edge is parallel to this vector, and the left side of the texture is nearer to the texture origin point.

**Copy From:** As an alternative to using the [!DNL 3D Import] tool to [assign a 3D plane to this object](../../../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-abt-obj-pg/t-vat-assign-obj.md#task-e8ad247824b24fb0b05e115df24c45b6), you can copy the 3D plane information directly from an object that already has a 3D plane assigned to it.

**Match Origin:** Equivalent to the [ [!DNL Match Origin]](../../../c-vat-flow-pg/c-vat-test-flow-work/t-vat-match-text.md#task-568d59da3f7e48838669b17fe96fbed0) choice on the context menu (displayed when you right-click a planar object with the [!DNL Alignment] tool).
