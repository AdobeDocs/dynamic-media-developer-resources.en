# About Cabinets with Glass Doors{#about-cabinets-with-glass-doors}

Image Authoring can render cabinets with glass doors if you prepare the cabinets properly.

 **To Create, Prepare, and Render Cabinets with Glass Doors:** 

1. On the [!DNL Object] page, create a Cabinet group and each cabinet object.
1. On the [!DNL Mask] page, mask the cabinets.
1. Go back to the [!DNL Object] page and select one of the Cabinet objects you masked.
1. Do one of the following:

    * If the cabinet is a [2D object](../../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-create-grps-obj/t-vat-create-2d-obj.md#task-b0c168d6f127408c882e8f1de36c8bc7), use the [ **[!UICONTROL Edit Model]** tool](../../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-obj-pg-tools/c-vat-edit-mod-tool/c-vat-edit-mod-tool.md#concept-1f0094296702446bbf2fa360abae7c8d) ![](assets/import_model.png) to set the perspective for the object. 
    
    * If the cabinet is a [3D object](../../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-create-grps-obj/t-vat-create-3d-obj.md#task-adac1e1e26024993aa97ed6c7e87c084), [assign it to a plane](../../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-abt-obj-pg/t-vat-assign-obj.md#task-e8ad247824b24fb0b05e115df24c45b6).

1. Use the [ **[!UICONTROL Alignment]** tool](../../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-obj-pg-tools/c-vat-align-tool.md#concept-2ba104eab0df4b00a52c70bbcd8177a8) ![](assets/alignment.png) to set the alignment for the object.
1. Use the [ **[!UICONTROL Layout]** tool](../../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-obj-pg-tools/c-vat-layout-tool/t-vat-def-cab-door.md#task-ec5f1cd1c65c4c2dbb65add62516b8ad) ![](assets/layout.png) to define the glass for the cabinet door.

    * Select the **[!UICONTROL Layout]** tool. 
    * Hold down the Ctrl key and right-click the cabinet. 
    * From the list that appears, choose **[!UICONTROL Left Hand Glass]** or **[!UICONTROL Right Hand Glass]**, depending on whether the cabinet opens to the left or to the right. 
    
    * Adjust the area containing the glass, then right-click again and choose **[!UICONTROL Apply]**.

1. Repeat steps 4 through 6 for the remaining cabinets.
1. On the [!DNL Render] page, [apply a texture to the cabinets and turn on the [!DNL Show Glass Doors] option.](../../c-vat-rend-pg/c-vat-rend-obj/t-vat-cab-opt.md#task-643510921338421ba329ecd4134ac252)
