# Working with Drop Shadows{#working-with-drop-shadows}

The following items support drop shadows:

** [Decal Materials:](../../c-vat-rend-pg/c-vat-rend-obj/c-vat-decals/t-vat-app-decal.md#task-16ff67be05f84b06b4c0caf73ff01f83) ** The [material thickness](../../c-vat-rend-pg/c-vat-work-text/c-vat-text-mat-prop/c-vat-text-mat-prop.md#concept-56e919cfd48748169dc2f011aa95c5fd) (a material attribute) is combined with the  light vector angle (set this on the [!DNL Texture] tab of the [!DNL Object Properties] dialog box) to determine the size and position of the drop shadow for a decal object.

** [Static Overlap Objects:](../../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-create-grps-obj/t-vat-overlap-obj.md#task-444f7cb2256040a48ba41ce380348465) ** The drop shadow must be built into the RGBA image, which can be [imported](../../c-vat-gs/c-vat-work-ps/c-vat-imp-ps/t-vat-drop-shadow.md#task-6841c28c174040578788cad5c853d5da) individually or with a layered PSD file. It is saved with the vignette.
