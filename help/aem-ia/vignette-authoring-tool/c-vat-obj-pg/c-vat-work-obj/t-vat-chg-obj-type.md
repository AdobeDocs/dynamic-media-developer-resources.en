# Changing an Object's Type{#changing-an-object-s-type}

After you create an object, you can change its type if it needs properties that are not available for the type you originally chose.

 **To Change an Object's Type:** 

1. In the [ [!DNL Object Explorer]](../../r-vat-glossary/c-vat-obj-explorer.md#concept-da56038ea82c40a1a10576f99f2f6836), right-click the object.
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Convert To]** command for the object type you want.
1. In the [!DNL Properties] dialog box that appears, change any object attributes as necessary, then click **[!UICONTROL OK]**.

   If you convert an object to an [overlap object type](../../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-abt-obj-pg/c-vat-abt-obj.md#concept-e4110bef9eae44b28c609b4444802753), specify a z-order value for it.
