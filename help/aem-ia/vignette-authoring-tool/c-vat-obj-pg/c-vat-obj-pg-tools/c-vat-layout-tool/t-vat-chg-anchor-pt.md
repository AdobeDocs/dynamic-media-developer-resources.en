# To Change the Anchor Point for a Decal Using the Layout Tool{#to-change-the-anchor-point-for-a-decal-using-the-layout-tool}

1. In the side menu, click the **[!UICONTROL Layout]** tool ![](assets/layout.png).
1. Select the object to which you [applied a decal](../../../c-vat-rend-pg/c-vat-rend-obj/c-vat-decals/t-vat-app-decal.md#task-16ff67be05f84b06b4c0caf73ff01f83).

   By default, a decal is centered on the [texture origin](../../../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-abt-obj-prop/c-vat-3d-obj-prop/c-vat-3d-flow-obj-prop/c-vat-text-tab-obj.md#concept-81d47c5bdaf64427a222acfee3e6d557). This appears on the image as a red box, which you can drag to reposition. 

1. Drag the red square.
1. Right-click and choose **[!UICONTROL Apply]**.
