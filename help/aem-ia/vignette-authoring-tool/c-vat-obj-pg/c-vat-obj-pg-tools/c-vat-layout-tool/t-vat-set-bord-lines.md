# To Set Border Lines for a Wall{#to-set-border-lines-for-a-wall}

1. In the side menu, click the **[!UICONTROL Layout]** tool ![](assets/layout.png).
1. The perspective bounding box for this wall is displayed in yellow.
1. Click the top line of the yellow bounding box.

   The lines of the box turn blue, and the border lines turn yellow. The three boundary lines are stacked on top of each other. 

1. Drag any border line from the top of the box to the bottom area of the wall, close to the floor.

   This line automatically becomes the bottom border line. Unless you plan to have a bottom border, the exact placement of the line doesn't matter. 

1. Click the top of the bounding box and drag another border line where the mid-wall border appears.

   The line indicates the top edge of the mid-wall border.

   Leave the third line at the top of the bounding box. The line indicates the top edge of the top border. 

1. To change the mid-wall border line so it indicates the bottom edge of the mid-wall border, right-click the wall and select **[!UICONTROL Center Border Upwards]**.
1. If you want a bottom border, drag the bottom border line to the floor.

   The line indicates the bottom edge of the border.

   You can also edit the borders by typing values on the [ [!DNL Wall Layout] tab in the [!DNL Object Properties] dialog box](../../../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-abt-obj-prop/c-vat-wall-obj-prop.md#concept-3903c8a656e049ea90b80f6f6caf4c02). 

1. When you are finished, right-click the wall and select **[!UICONTROL Apply]**.
