# The 3D Import Tool{#the-d-import-tool}

If you are creating a three-dimensional vignette and you created geometry in the 3D Modeling page, you must import it on the Object page in order to use it.

You also use the [!DNL 3D Import] tool to [attach planar objects to geometric planes](../../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-abt-obj-pg/t-vat-assign-obj.md#task-e8ad247824b24fb0b05e115df24c45b6).
