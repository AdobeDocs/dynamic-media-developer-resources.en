# The Image Map tool{#the-image-map-tool}

Image maps are used only on websites that support dynamic rendering.

The areas on the image map become the clickable areas on the website.

If you plan to implement image maps, you can [generate one automatically](../../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-img-maps/t-vat-create-img-map.md#task-a6fa69cb34ce4244ab31940c4de08f59) with the [!DNL Image Map] tool, then [edit the resulting map](../../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-img-maps/t-vat-edit-img-map.md#task-c36b75f043b3402da9caf6062f8231ba). You may want to edit image map areas that are divided into many small areas, to redefine them as a single area. This helps to ensure that the user selects the intended object when he clicks. Changes to the image map do not affect changes to the object masks.

To create the image map HTML file required by the [!DNL Image Rendering] server, process the image with the [ [!DNL Vignette Update] tool](../../c-vat-gs/c-vat-prep-img-dyn-rend/c-vat-img-rend-sys/c-vat-abt-vign-update-tool.md#concept-61c09096c9384766b30097c814780780).
