# The Edit Model tool{#the-edit-model-tool}

The Edit Model tool lets you set perspective for 2D, non-flowline objects, such as walls, flat objects, cabinets, doors, and appliances.

Setting the perspective can help insure that textures are sized properly when you apply them. You should know the height and width of the object you are sizing. Otherwise, you may have to use trial and error to get an accurate texture size.

You also use this tool to define where a [!DNL Flowline Object with Extrusion] meets the plane on which it is sitting.

To see examples of how to use this tool, see the following:
