# About Sub-Groups{#about-sub-groups}

A sub-group is a group within a group.

Sub-groups allow objects to be associated with other objects, without necessarily taking on all of their characteristics.

For example, the kitchen vignette below contains a dishwasher. You want a customer to be able to select the dishwasher and apply a color...

... or a cabinet front that matches the surrounding cabinets:

If the dishwasher is in a separate sub-group, the customer can choose whether the dishwasher receives a color or adapts the finish of the surrounding cabinets.

In the illustration below, the group Cabinets contains four sub-groups: wall cabinets, base cabinets, refrigerator, and dishwasher.
