# Changing the Zoom Increment{#changing-the-zoom-increment}

You can change the amount zoomed when you use the zoom commands.

1. On the [!DNL Edit] menu, select **[!UICONTROL Preferences]**.
1. In the [!DNL General] tab, set the [!DNL Number of Steps for 2X Zoom].

   Indicate how many times you would need to click the zoom icon to double the view of the image. By default, the image doubles in size when you click once.
