# Adjusting Your View{#adjusting-your-view}

 To change the appearance of [!DNL Image Authoring], or of images within it, do the following:

* [Zoom in or out](../c-vat-img-auth-opt/c-vat-zoom.md#concept-026c3692c4dd44859aaf9e805614d6ad). 
* [Change the percentage of magnification for a zoom operation](../c-vat-img-auth-opt/t-vat-zoom-increm.md#task-6f84cdfe4629446596ce54d4c6f8f3ef). 
* [Size the window when you zoom](../c-vat-img-auth-opt/t-vat-zoom-window.md#task-429677ded55340b0ad77dfed01426073). 
* [Change the width of the tool area](../c-vat-img-auth-opt/c-vat-side-menu-area.md#concept-ce061aa621464ecd8cbf1f1c1011776d). 
* [Resize a window](../c-vat-img-auth-opt/c-vat-resize-window.md#concept-963d33b9e0c845eab6b823f1abfeb95e) so you can easily switch between open windows. 
* [Split the view](../c-vat-img-auth-opt/c-vat-split-views.md#concept-c1dc8828c53645a885836550cefafbb6) of a window so you can zoom in on a detail. 
* [Change the color of the workspace](../c-vat-img-auth-opt/t-vat-chg-color-img-worksp.md#task-41ef4be3658349028871075e77b22457) surrounding your image.
