# Changing the Color of the Image Workspace{#changing-the-color-of-the-image-workspace}

You can adjust the amount of space surrounding your photo, and you can change the color of that space.

This is useful if you want to see how the edges of the image appear on a background color (for example, if your Web page uses a background color).

**To Change the Color of the Image Workspace:** 

1. On the [!DNL Edit] menu, select **[!UICONTROL Preferences]**.
1. In the [!DNL General] tab, click the **[!UICONTROL Set]** button, then choose the color you want.
1. When you are finished, click **[!UICONTROL OK]**.
**To Change the Margin:**

1. On the [!DNL Edit] menu, select **[!UICONTROL Preferences]**. 

1. In the [!DNL General] tab, enter a percentage in the [!DNL Margin width (% of image size)] box.
