# Sizing the Window When You Zoom{#sizing-the-window-when-you-zoom}

You can set a preference that determines whether the window size changes when you change the magnification.

If this preference is set, [!DNL Image Authoring] makes the window smaller when you zoom out and larger when you zoom in. This lets you see more of the image at large zoom settings and less extraneous areas at small zoom settings.

**To Resize the Window When You Zoom:** 

1. On the [!DNL Edit] menu, select **[!UICONTROL Preferences]**.
1. In the [!DNL General] tab, check **[!UICONTROL Auto-fit window when zooming]**.
