# Resizing Windows{#resizing-windows}

You can change the size of the window displaying the current vignette.

The window detaches from the left-hand pane, so you can move it and see other views. You can return the window to full size without reattaching it to the pane, or you can reattach it.

**To Resize a Window:**

* In the upper right corner, click the **[!UICONTROL Restore]** button for the window.
