# Changing the Blur Filter{#changing-the-blur-filter}

The blur filter affects the way that texture is applied to individual pixels.

If you don't like the default setting, try different options for different texture types. The [!DNL Triangle] setting (which is the default) shows the most detail, but other choices may work better for different surface/texture combinations.

**To Change the Blur Filter:** 

1. On the [!DNL Edit] menu, select **[!UICONTROL Preferences]**.
1. In the [!DNL General] tab, for [!DNL Type of blur filter used by illumination tools], choose from **[!UICONTROL Box]**, **[!UICONTROL Triangle]**, **[!UICONTROL Gaussian]**, and **[!UICONTROL Cubic]**.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL OK]**.
