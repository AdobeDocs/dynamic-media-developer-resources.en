# Previewing Images Before You Open Them{#previewing-images-before-you-open-them}

You can set a preference that displays a thumbnail of image files in all dialog boxes where you open images.

This includes the [!DNL Load From File] dialog box (available from [!DNL View Properties]), the [!DNL Preview Material] dialog box, and others.

You can also preview vignettes whose version is 55 or higher; older vignettes do not display a preview image. ICC color profiles are not applied to previews.

If you open images stored on a network drive, previewing them can slow performance significantly.

**To Preview Images Before You Open Them:** 

1. On the [!DNL Edit] menu, select **[!UICONTROL Preferences]**.
1. On the [!DNL General] tab, check **[!UICONTROL Show preview thumbnail in Image File Open dialogs]**.
Any dialog box that opens image files has a [!DNL Preview] checkbox. If you clear this checkbox, you also turn off the preview preference in the [!DNL Preferences] dialog box, and vice versa.
