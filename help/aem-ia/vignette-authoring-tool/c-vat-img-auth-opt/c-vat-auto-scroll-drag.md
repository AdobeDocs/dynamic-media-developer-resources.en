When this preference is checked, [!DNL Image Authoring] scrolls when you drag the cursor outside the current view so that you can see the effects of your mouse movement. This applies to operations with vector-based tools, such as the [!DNL Trace] tool on the [!DNL Mask] page and the [!DNL Add Feature] tool on the [!DNL Sketch] page. It does not affect the [!DNL 3D Modeling] page.
