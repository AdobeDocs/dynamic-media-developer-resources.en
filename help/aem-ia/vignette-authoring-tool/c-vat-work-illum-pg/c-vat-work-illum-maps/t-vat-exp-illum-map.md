# Exporting the Illumination Map{#exporting-the-illumination-map}

You can export the Illumination Map in order to fine-tune it with another application, for example, Photoshop.

You can export the [!DNL Illumination Map] and the mask information in [!DNL Photoshop] format, or you can export the [!DNL Illumination Map] only.

When you have finished fine-tuning the information, you can [import](../../c-vat-work-illum-pg/c-vat-work-illum-maps/t-vat-imp-illum-map.md#task-2171a079ad2b45ada70487cbbcff5d89) the resulting [!DNL Illumination Map] back into [!DNL Image Authoring].
