# Resetting the Illumination Map{#resetting-the-illumination-map}

You can delete the existing Illumination Map and start over.

You can also return to the [!DNL Illumination Map] that was in effect for a particular object or group the last time that the file was saved.

**To Delete the Current Illumination Map:** 

1. Ctrl-click ![](assets/finger.png) in the toolbar to see the [!DNL View Properties] dialog.
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Illumination]** tab.
1. Next to Map A, click the **[!UICONTROL Action]** button and select **[!UICONTROL Delete]**.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL OK]**.
1. Use the [tools](../../c-vat-work-illum-pg/c-vat-abt-illum-pg/c-vat-abt-illum-pg.md#concept-1be06b3c0416437088e7cbbba48b3e5f) on the [!DNL Illumination] page ![](assets/illum_button.png) to create a new [!DNL Illumination Map].
** To Revert to the Last Saved Illumination Map:**

1. Go to the [!DNL Illumination] page by clicking its button ![](assets/illum_button.png).

Reverting is available only if you have already saved the vignette.
