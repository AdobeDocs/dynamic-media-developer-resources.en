# Importing an Illumination Map{#importing-an-illumination-map}

When you create a vignette, an Illumination Map is generated automatically.

You can also create and import an [!DNL Illumination Map] using a third-party graphics tool such as [ [!DNL Photoshop]](../../c-vat-gs/c-vat-work-ps/t-vat-prep-img-ps.md#task-f796b659745740028b561d61ab9823ea), then import it into [!DNL Image Authoring]. You may prefer this approach if you wish to take advantage of tools that are not available in [!DNL Image Authoring] (for example, the Levels tool in [!DNL Photoshop]).

If you create illumination in [!DNL Photoshop] using the Curves tool, you can export that information to an [!DNL .amp] file and load it into [!DNL Image Authoring] using the [ [!DNL Histogram] tool](../../c-vat-work-illum-pg/c-vat-illum-pg-tools/c-vat-histo-tool/c-vat-histo-tool.md#concept-bee364575d6d49c4a00a3f6609550f24).

**To Import an Illumination Map You Created in Photoshop:** 

1. Go to the [!DNL Object] page by clicking the **[!UICONTROL Object Page]** button ![](assets/object_page.png).
1. In the [ [!DNL Object Explorer]](../../r-vat-glossary/c-vat-obj-explorer.md#concept-da56038ea82c40a1a10576f99f2f6836), double-click the view object in the hierarchy.
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Illumination]** tab, click the **[!UICONTROL Action]** button next to Map A, then choose **[!UICONTROL Load from File]**.
1. Select the image you want to use and click **[!UICONTROL Open]**. You may have to navigate to another folder to locate the file.
1. To view the file you opened, click the **[!UICONTROL Action]** button and choose **[!UICONTROL Show Image]**.
1. When you are finished, click **[!UICONTROL OK]**.
