# The Noise Brush{#the-noise-brush}

The Noise Brush can be used to break up banding in an image.

Banding can occur when you increase the contrast in the illumination map.

**To Add Noise:** 

1. Select an object or group in the [ [!DNL Select Object] box](../../c-vat-gs/c-vat-sel-obj/c-vat-sel-object-box.md#concept-d127c6efaabd436a96c02f36a7bce6ac).
1. In the side menu, click the **[!UICONTROL Noise Brush]** ![](assets/noise.png).
1. In the image, drag the brush over the area where you want to add noise.
You can set the following options for the [!DNL Noise Brush]:

* **Noise Amount:** The higher the percentage, the more pronounced the effect. 
* **Apply to Whole Object:** Applies your changes to the entire object or group that is currently selected.
