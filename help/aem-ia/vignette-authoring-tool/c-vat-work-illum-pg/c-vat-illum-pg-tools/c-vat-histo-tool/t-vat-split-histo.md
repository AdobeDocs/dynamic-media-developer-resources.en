# To Split the Histogram, then Change the Brightness for the Split Areas{#to-split-the-histogram-then-change-the-brightness-for-the-split-areas}

1. Click the [!DNL Histogram] where you want the split to occur.
1. Hold down the Ctrl key, then drag the new dotted split line up or down.

   You can also drag other split lines. Only the area on either side of a dragged line is affected. 

1. Continue to make adjustments until you are satisfied with the results.
1. When you are finished, click **[!UICONTROL Apply]**.
You can save illumination settings you made with the [!DNL Histogram] tool. These settings are saved in the [!DNL .amp] format used for illumination settings made in [!DNL Photoshop] with the Curves tool and saved to a file. You can load these settings for future use, for example, to apply the same settings to a set of related images.
