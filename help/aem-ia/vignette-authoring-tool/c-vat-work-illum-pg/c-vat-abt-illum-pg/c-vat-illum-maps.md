# About Illumination Maps{#about-illumination-maps}

The default Illumination Map is created automatically.

 [You can change the [!DNL Illumination Map]](../../c-vat-work-illum-pg/c-vat-work-illum-maps/t-vat-illum-map-img-auth.md#task-0342a45d98cd456aa4e7cbff6a46ca47) with the tools in the [!DNL Illumination] page.

If you prefer, you can [import](../../c-vat-work-illum-pg/c-vat-work-illum-maps/t-vat-illum-map-ps.md#task-6cc4c3a18c544a6f815dd63932fd9172) an [!DNL Illumination Map] you have created with a third-party graphics tool such as [!DNL Photoshop]. You can also [copy and adjust the default [!DNL Illumination Map] in the [!DNL View Properties] dialog box](../../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-abt-obj-prop/c-vat-view-prop.md#concept-8a396f7b144c46c4806c8ed26619eed1).

If you have created an illumination profile using the [!DNL Curves] tool in [!DNL Photoshop], you can export that profile as an [!DNL .amp] file and load it using the [ [!DNL Histogram] tool](../../c-vat-work-illum-pg/c-vat-illum-pg-tools/c-vat-histo-tool/c-vat-histo-tool.md#concept-bee364575d6d49c4a00a3f6609550f24).

If certain materials require different illumination than others, you can use [ [!DNL Render] settings](../../c-vat-rend-pg/c-vat-work-text/c-vat-text-mat-prop/c-vat-render.md#concept-c2c8c5e35662417c9508f85b52b24960) to change illumination options for rendering only, without affecting the [!DNL Illumination Map].
