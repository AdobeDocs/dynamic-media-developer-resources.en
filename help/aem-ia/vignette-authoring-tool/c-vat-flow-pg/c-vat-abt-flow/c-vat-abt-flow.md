# About the Flowline Page{#about-the-flowline-page}

After you mask the objects in your vignette, you use the Flowline page to ensure that materials follow the contours of objects in the vignette.

In the [!DNL Flowline] Page, each masked object has a [!DNL Flowline Mesh]. You mold an object's [!DNL Flowline Mesh] so it duplicates the shape of the object as closely as possible.

If your vignette contains only [Non-Texturable Objects](../../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-create-grps-obj/t-vat-create-2d-obj.md#task-b0c168d6f127408c882e8f1de36c8bc7), you don't need to create flowlines. Instead, go on to [rendering](../../c-vat-rend-pg/c-vat-abt-rend-pg/c-vat-abt-rend-pg.md#concept-0a56eec3cafe45658d25c0988d818fc0).

To go to the [!DNL Flowline] page, click the **[!UICONTROL Flowline Page]** button on the toolbar:

The [!DNL Flowline] tool buttons are displayed on the right side of the screen.

When you move from the [!DNL Mask] Page to the [!DNL Flowline] Page, the last object you masked is still active and its name is displayed in the [ [!DNL Select Object] box](../../c-vat-gs/c-vat-sel-obj/c-vat-sel-object-box.md#concept-d127c6efaabd436a96c02f36a7bce6ac).

If you worked on a previous object, the current object is covered with the last pattern you applied. Otherwise, [!DNL Image Authoring] uses the default texture.

If the object you are editing doesn't have illumination, it may not display the texture you choose. Go to the [!DNL Illumination] page and [create illumination](../../c-vat-work-illum-pg/c-vat-work-illum-maps/t-vat-prev-illum-map.md#task-97d59c12deaf444cbde412761e8d18e1)for the object.
