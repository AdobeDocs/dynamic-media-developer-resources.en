# Changing the Direction of a Texture{#changing-the-direction-of-a-texture}

You can flip a texture vertically or horizontally for a flowline object.

This is useful if you discover that you assumed the wrong direction for the texture.

**To Change the Direction of a Texture:** 

1. Make sure the [!DNL Texture] tool is active ![](assets/texture.png).
1. Right-click the object in the image and do one of the following:

    * To reverse the direction of the texture vertically, select **[!UICONTROL Flip Vertical]**. 
    * To reverse the direction of the texture horizontally, select **[!UICONTROL Flip Horizontal]**. 
    * To switch the X and Y values of the texture, select **[!UICONTROL Transpose]**.

   You can [change the direction of a texture for a flat object](../../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-obj-pg-tools/c-vat-align-tool.md#concept-2ba104eab0df4b00a52c70bbcd8177a8) using the [!DNL Alignment] tool on the [!DNL Object] page.
