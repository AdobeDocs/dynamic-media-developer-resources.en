# Changing the Depth of a Texture{#changing-the-depth-of-a-texture}

You can pull the texture towards you and away from the photo, or push it away from you into the photo, at the point where the texture flows into a vertex.

You can perform this procedure only on a corner vertex of the [!DNL Flowline Mesh].

**To Change the Texture Depth:** 

1. Make sure the [!DNL Mesh] tool is active ![](assets/mesh_tool.png).
1. In the side menu, select **[!UICONTROL Show Depth Markers]**. ![](assets/depth_markers.png)

1. Select the vertex to change.
1. Do one of the following:

    * To pull the texture towards you, press the right arrow key one or more times. A blue circle appears around the vertex to indicate it has been pulled. 
    * To push the texture away from you, press the left arrow key one or more times. A red circle appears around the vertex to indicate it has been pushed. 
    * In the side menu, drag the [!DNL Depth] slider to the left or right.
