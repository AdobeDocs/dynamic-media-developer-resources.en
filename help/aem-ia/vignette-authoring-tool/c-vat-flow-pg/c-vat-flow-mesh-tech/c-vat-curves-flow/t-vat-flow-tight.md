# To Make Flowlines Tight or Loose{#to-make-flowlines-tight-or-loose}

1. Make sure the [!DNL Mesh] tool is active ![](assets/mesh_tool.png).
1. Hold down the Shift key and click a vertical flowline.
1. In the side menu, specify whether to adjust the [!DNL Vertical] or [!DNL Horizontal] tension and drag the [!DNL Tension] slider to the left (for a tighter line) or the right (for a looser line).

   Tension settings are applied to all vertices in the current selection collectively. If no flowlines or vertices are selected, the tension change is applied to all flowlines.

   Use settings in the mid-range of the slider. The extreme ends of the slider produce results that are either completely angular (tight) or distorted (loose).
