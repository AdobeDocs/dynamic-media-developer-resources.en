# To Stretch a Texture by Changing the Value Amount{#to-stretch-a-texture-by-changing-the-value-amount}

1. Make sure the [!DNL Texture] tool is active ![](assets/texture.png).
1. Shift-click the flowline to stretch.
1. In the side menu, change the amount in the [!DNL Value] box.
A lower amount pushes more of the texture into the right-hand or lower section. A higher amount pushes more of the texture into the left-hand or upper section (depending on whether the flowline is vertical or horizontal).
