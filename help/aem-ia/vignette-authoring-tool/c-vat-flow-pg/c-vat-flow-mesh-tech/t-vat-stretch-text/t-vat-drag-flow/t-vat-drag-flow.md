# To Stretch a Texture by Dragging Flowlines{#to-stretch-a-texture-by-dragging-flowlines}

1. Make sure the [!DNL Texture] tool is active ![](assets/texture.png).
1. Place the pointer over a flowline until the pointer looks like this ![](assets/grab_cursor.png).
1. Drag into one of the sections on either side of the flowline.

   In the section you drag into, the texture compresses. In the section you drag away from, the texture stretches.

   You can also Shift-click a second flowline once the first flowline is selected. To do this, select one flowline, then hold down the Shift key and select any other flowline that follows the same direction as the first one. The two flowlines do not have to be adjacent. When you drag, the texture squeezes to one side of the region defined by the two flowlines.
