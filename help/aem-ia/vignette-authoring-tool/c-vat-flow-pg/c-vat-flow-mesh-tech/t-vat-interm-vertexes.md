# Deleting Intermediate Vertexes{#deleting-intermediate-vertexes}

You can remove all the vertexes between two corner vertexes.

If the added vertexes had caused the line to become curved, the line reverts to being straight again.

**To Remove Intermediate Vertexes:** 

1. Make sure the [!DNL Mesh] tool is active ![](assets/mesh_tool.png).
1. Click a vertex on the line that contains the [vertexes](../../r-vat-glossary/c-vat-vertexes.md#concept-75f0f5b2b22745d18a7245bb0b03e4a1) to delete.
1. Press the right mouse button and select **[!UICONTROL Delete Intermediate Vertices]**.
