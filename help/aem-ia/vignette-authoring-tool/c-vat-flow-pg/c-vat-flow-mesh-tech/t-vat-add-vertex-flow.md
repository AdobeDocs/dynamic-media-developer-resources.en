# Adding a Vertex to a Flowline{#adding-a-vertex-to-a-flowline}

After you add a vertex, you can drag it to reshape the Flowline Mesh, or use the arrow keys to move it one pixel at a time.

You can also [change its depth](../../c-vat-flow-pg/c-vat-flow-mesh-tech/t-vat-depth-text.md#task-18d316e8b07d4f5a859589ae96f97693), [make it straight or curved](t_vat_curves_flowlines.md#task_A85DBC16ABD447659DE2B0358E7A6A1A), or [delete](../../c-vat-flow-pg/c-vat-flow-mesh-tech/t-vat-interm-vertexes.md#task-629c07f8a541452db16d7fd61bc3b952) it.

**To Use a Vertex to Reshape a Flowline:** 

1. Make sure the [!DNL Mesh] tool is active ![](assets/mesh_tool.png).
1. Click the flowline where you want the vertex.
1. Move the pointer over a vertex until you see the drag cursor ![](assets/drag_cursor.png).
1. Click the vertex and drag it to a new position.
