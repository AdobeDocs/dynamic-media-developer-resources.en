# Changing the Orientation of the Flowline Mesh{#changing-the-orientation-of-the-flowline-mesh}

By default, the Flowline Mesh is a rectangle with a horizontal/vertical orientation—straight up and down.

Start by slanting the [!DNL Flowline Mesh] to match the angle of the object.

**To Change the Angle of the Flowline Mesh:** 

1. Hold down the Shift key and move the pointer over a flowline until you see a grab cursor ![](assets/grab_cursor.png).
1. Drag the flowline, slanting the mesh into the correct orientation.
