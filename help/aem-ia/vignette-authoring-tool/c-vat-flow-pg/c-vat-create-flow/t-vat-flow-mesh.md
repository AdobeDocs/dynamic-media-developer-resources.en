# Starting the Flowline Mesh{#starting-the-flowline-mesh}

The Flowline Mesh helps you see the results of your work.

The [!DNL Flowline Mesh] won't be visible in the completed image on your website. It is there to help you create flowlines that display your real patterns and textures realistically.

Initially, the [!DNL Flowline Mesh] is flat. You mold it to match the way that fabric drapes on the object.

**To Create a Flowline:** 

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Flowlines Page]** button ![](assets/flowline_button.png) to see the [!DNL Flowlines] page (if it isn't already displayed).
1. Make sure the object you want is selected in the [ [!DNL Select Object] box](../../c-vat-gs/c-vat-sel-obj/c-vat-sel-object-box.md#concept-d127c6efaabd436a96c02f36a7bce6ac).
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Mesh]** tool ![](assets/flowline_button.png).
1. In the side menu, click the **[!UICONTROL Normal]** display option (if it isn't already selected).
1. If you need to, move the [!DNL Flowline Mesh] by placing the pointer inside it, holding down the Shift key, and dragging.
1. If you need to, [change the pattern](../../c-vat-flow-pg/c-vat-test-flow-work/t-vat-prev-text.md#task-ae35e07a54de4eebb9c17721f54e1132) used to display the [!DNL Flowline Mesh].
1. [Match the angle](../../c-vat-flow-pg/c-vat-create-flow/t-vat-orient-flow-mesh.md#task-dc5a2217d0344f17a0533b1656c0d237) of the [!DNL Flowline Mesh] to the angle of the object.
1. [Change the contours](../../c-vat-flow-pg/c-vat-create-flow/t-vat-contour-flow-mesh.md#task-1d891b7540014e5c823278c5e4d69dbb) of the [!DNL Flowline Mesh] to match the bends in the object.
