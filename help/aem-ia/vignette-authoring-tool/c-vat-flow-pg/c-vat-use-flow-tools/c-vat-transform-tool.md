# The Transform Tool{#the-transform-tool}

Use the Transform tool to manipulate the entire flowline mesh.

You can copy the flowline mesh to a different object, then use these modes to adjust the mesh to that object.

The [!DNL Transform] tool has the following modes:

* **Free:** Lets you freely manipulate the mesh by scaling it using any of the handles or performing a free rotation. 
* **Scale:** Stretches the mesh but retains its aspect ratio. 
* **Rotate:** Lets you move the mesh to a different angle. This is useful if you want to copy the entire mesh to a different object that is similar but is in a different position. To change the rotation point, drag the red square to the new location, then rotate the mesh. To place the rotation point back at the center, right-click and select **[!UICONTROL Re-center Axis]**. 

* **Skew:** Stretches horizontally or vertically. You cannot drag from the middle handles, away from the center of the object. 
* **Distort:** Lets you adjust individual points of the mesh independently. You can stretch in the horizontal and vertical position at the same time and go beyond the boundary of the object. 
* **Perspective:** Changes opposite sides of the object equally. You can use it to expand or compress the corners of the mesh in the same proportions.
