# The Mesh Tool{#the-mesh-tool}

Use the Mesh tool to create flowlines that display your real patterns and textures realistically.

The [!DNL Mesh] tool has the following options:

* **Tension:** Determines the [amount of curve in the fold](c_vat_flow_tension_ex.md#concept_BA517724D8E942C6BAC1AB98AE976577). 

* **Depth and Show Depth Markers:** Let you [pull or push textures](../../c-vat-flow-pg/c-vat-flow-mesh-tech/t-vat-depth-text.md#task-18d316e8b07d4f5a859589ae96f97693) away from the viewer. 

* **Reset All Depths:** Returns the [!DNL Flowline Depth] to its original setting for all flowlines. 

* **New Mesh:** [Undoes your flowline work](../../c-vat-flow-pg/c-vat-flow-mesh-tech/t-vat-reset-flow-mesh.md#task-aa61cad8897341ad82b7177122866b87) so far and creates a default mesh. By default, the new mesh is a bounding box with however many vertical and horizontal flowlines are indicated in the two fields. To include more, type a number for the vertical flowlines into the first box and a number for the horizontal flowlines into the second box. The flowlines will be equally spaced. Your new setting remains in effect until you exit [!DNL Image Authoring]. To change the setting permanently, change the [ [!DNL Default Flowline Spacing]](../../c-vat-flow-pg/c-vat-abt-flow/c-vat-flow-pg-pref.md#concept-304fb083a8a0415991216916b427246e) in the [!DNL Preferences] dialog box.

The right-click menu contains commands that let you choose different vertex types. [ [!DNL Make Selected Vertices Sharp] and [!DNL Make Selected Vertices Curved]](t_vat_curves_flowlines.md#task_A85DBC16ABD447659DE2B0358E7A6A1A) adjusts the tension of flowline vertexes.
