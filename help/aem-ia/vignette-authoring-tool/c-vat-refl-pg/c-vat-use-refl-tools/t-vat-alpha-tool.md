# The Alpha Tool{#the-alpha-tool}

Use this tool to fill in the gaps between reflection areas in the Reflection Map.

 ** To Correct the Alpha Map for Reflections:** 

1. [Generate the [!DNL Reflection Map]](../../c-vat-refl-pg/c-vat-use-refl-tools/c-vat-refl-map-tool.md#concept-fc4781136f994df6b11654c993a7a506) for the entire image.
1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Alpha]** tool ![](assets/alpha.png).
1. To blur the edges between very bright and very dark areas, check the [!DNL Soft Edges] option.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Correct Alpha]**.
1. Check the results by choosing [!DNL Alpha] as the [!DNL Image] option.

   To make further adjustments, leave the [!DNL Image] set to [!DNL Alpha], select an object, and use the [ [!DNL Brightness]](../../c-vat-refl-pg/c-vat-use-refl-tools/t-vat-bright-brush/t-vat-bright-brush.md#task-402cd15757a44494ada59039d97ffcf7) and [ [!DNL Blur]](../../c-vat-work-illum-pg/c-vat-illum-pg-tools/t-vat-blur-brush.md#task-55246cb1b6524aa8828798e78e612dd2) brushes to make adjustments.
