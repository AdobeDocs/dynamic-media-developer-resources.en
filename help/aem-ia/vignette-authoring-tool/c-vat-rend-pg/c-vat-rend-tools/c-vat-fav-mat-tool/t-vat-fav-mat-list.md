# To Save Materials to the Favorite Materials List{#to-save-materials-to-the-favorite-materials-list}

1. Select the object or group whose material you want to save.

   Select an object or group by choosing it from the [ [!DNL Select Object] box](../../../c-vat-gs/c-vat-sel-obj/c-vat-sel-object-box.md#concept-d127c6efaabd436a96c02f36a7bce6ac) or by clicking it. Click once to select the group. If it has sub-groups, each additional click selects the subordinate group until you reach the object. At that point, additional clicks cycle back until you reach the group level.

   If you use the mouse-click method, check the [!DNL Select Object] box to see what's selected. 

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Apply New Material]** ![](assets/new_material.png) and apply a material.
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Favorite Materials]** tool ![](assets/fav_mat.png).
1. Right-click the **[!UICONTROL Favorite Materials]** list and choose **[!UICONTROL New Folder]**.
1. Type a name for this collection of materials, for example, "Living Room Materials," then press **[!UICONTROL Enter]**.
1. Right-click the new folder and choose the appropriate **[!UICONTROL Add Applied]** command.

   If you applied an unnamed solid color to this object, [!DNL Image Authoring] asks you to name the material. (If you named the color in the [!DNL Saved Materials] list, that name is used.) For textures, [!DNL Image Authoring] uses the file name for that texture unless you named the texture in [!DNL Material History] or [!DNL Saved Materials], in which case the name you supplied is used.

   The [!DNL Favorite Materials] list displays the names of all folders you've created. Click any folder to display its contents.
