# To Share Textures in the Favorite Materials List with Other Users{#to-share-textures-in-the-favorite-materials-list-with-other-users}

1. Make sure that all textures you want to share are in a location accessible to other users before you add them to your [!DNL Favorite Materials] list.
1. Create your [!DNL Favorite Materials] list, exit [!DNL Image Authoring], and use Windows Explorer to navigate to the folder where [!DNL Image Authoring] is installed.

   You must exit [!DNL Image Authoring] to be sure your [!DNL Favorite Materials] file is updated.

   Usually, [!DNL Image Authoring] is installed in [!DNL Program Files\Scene7\ImageAuthoring]. 

1. Find the [!DNL vat.vnm] file.
1. Copy the [!DNL vat.vnm] file to a location accessible by other users.

   For example, copy it to a network drive. 

1. Tell the other users to copy the file to their own installation folders for [!DNL Image Authoring].

   Users may need administrator access to replace these files. If any materials in your [!DNL Favorite Materials] list use ICC color profiles, you must provide those profiles as well. When another user copies your [!DNL Favorite Materials] list, your list replaces the user's previous [!DNL Favorites] list, as well as the [!DNL Material History] list and the [!DNL Preview Textures] used for the [!DNL Flowline] and [!DNL Sketch] pages. If this is not desirable, copy the texture files only to a location accessible by other users. Those users can then apply the textures and save them to their own [!DNL Favorite Materials] lists.
