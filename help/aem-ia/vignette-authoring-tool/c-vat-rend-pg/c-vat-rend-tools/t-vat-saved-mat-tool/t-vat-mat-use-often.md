# To Save Materials You Use Often{#to-save-materials-you-use-often}

1. Select the object or group whose material you want to save.

   Select an object or group by choosing it from the [!DNL Select Object] box or clicking it. Click once to select the group. If it has sub-groups, each additional click selects the subordinate group until you reach the object. At that point, additional clicks cycle back until you reach the group level.

   If you use the mouse-click method, check the [ [!DNL Select Object] box](../../../c-vat-gs/c-vat-sel-obj/c-vat-sel-object-box.md#concept-d127c6efaabd436a96c02f36a7bce6ac) to see what's selected. 

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Apply New Material]** ![](assets/new_material.png) and apply a texture, solid color, cabinet finish, or border.
1. Right-click the object and choose **[!UICONTROL Save Material]**.

   For borders, this command is on the **[!UICONTROL Borders]** > **[!UICONTROL Save Border]** submenu. The part of the wall that the border is currently applied is saved along with the material information.

   The [!DNL Saved Materials] list displays the hierarchy for your vignette, with the current texture shown for the object or group to which it was applied. If you are applying a solid color you haven't named before, you are prompted to name it. Otherwise [!DNL Image Authoring] uses the filename of the texture you are applying. If you changed this name in [!DNL Material History] or [!DNL Favorite Materials], your new name is used.
