# About Window Coverings{#about-window-coverings}

Use the Content Authoring tool to create window-covering images as separate objects you can import and use in Image Authoring.

For example, you can create a set of drapes or a shade, then add that window covering to a window or windows in any photographic image in [!DNL Image Authoring].

The [!DNL Content Authoring] tool lets you adjust the window covering, add opacity information and a thickness, and create a final window-covering image.

You create a special object in [!DNL Image Authoring] called a window covering frame to accept window coverings. This object is not like other [!DNL Image Authoring] objects, and you cannot convert between this object type and other object types.

You apply the window covering image to the window covering frame. You can apply different textures or colors to the window covering, and you can control its drop-shadow.
