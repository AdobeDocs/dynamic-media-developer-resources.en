# Rendering with a Texture{#rendering-with-a-texture}

You can render using a texture that you have stored in a file.

For information about creating texture files, see [Creating a Full-Tile Repeat](../../c-vat-troubleshooting/r-vat-full-tile-repeat/r-vat-full-tile-repeat.md#reference-7dc916534a864b2d9a5d21ca31056b54).

**To Render Using a Texture:** 

1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Render]** page by clicking its button ![](assets/render.png).
1. Select the object or group to render.

   You can use the [ [!DNL Select Object] box](../../c-vat-gs/c-vat-sel-obj/c-vat-sel-object-box.md#concept-d127c6efaabd436a96c02f36a7bce6ac) or you can click the object in the image. Click once to select the group. If it has sub-groups, each additional click selects the subordinate group until you reach the object. At that point, additional clicks cycle back until you reach the group level. If you use the mouse-click method, check the [!DNL Select Object] box to see what's selected.

   If you want to apply a decal, select a single object (not a group).

   If you want to apply a border to part of a wall, select a sub-selection. 

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Apply New Material]** Button ![](assets/new_material.png) and choose **[!UICONTROL Apply Texture]**.
1. Navigate to your texture file, select it, and choose **[!UICONTROL Open]**.
If you have [set a preference to do so](../../c-vat-rend-pg/c-vat-abt-rend-pg/c-vat-rend-pg-pref.md#concept-158b19aeeda74bb28fcac3b684ca1efc), a prompt lets you set the resolution for the new texture. To bypass this prompt, hold down the Shift key when you click **[!UICONTROL Open]**.

If the texture does not have an embedded color profile, you are prompted to assign one or to indicate that you do not want to use [color management](../../c-vat-gs/c-vat-abt-color-mgmt/c-vat-abt-color-mgmt.md#concept-2a2d355fd8e841ca95a926397aed4cab) for this texture.

You can also apply materials using the following:

* The [ [!DNL Saved Materials] list](../../c-vat-rend-pg/c-vat-rend-tools/t-vat-saved-mat-tool/t-vat-saved-mat-tool.md#task-2f7dd900c44e42f4a8e7f41a3003e2fa)
* The [ [!DNL Material History] list](../../c-vat-rend-pg/c-vat-rend-tools/t-vat-mat-hist-tool.md#task-95e1391588974719bbf93850448d547b)
* The [ [!DNL Favorite Materials] list ](../../c-vat-rend-pg/c-vat-rend-tools/c-vat-fav-mat-tool/t-vat-fav-mat-list.md#task-488e210530c24f6bbf7b37d0b6109b61)
* [Drag-and-drop](../../c-vat-rend-pg/c-vat-rend-obj/t-vat-drag-text.md#task-cad3f740e6194876b25ca2704630aeec) from the [!DNL Image Production System] or from Windows Explorer.
