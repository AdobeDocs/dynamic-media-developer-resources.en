# Applying a Decal{#applying-a-decal}

You can add a decal to any surface.

A decal is any single-repeat, flat object that appears on top of another object. Examples include an area rug on a wood floor, a picture on a painted wall, or a logo on a patterned blouse. Some settings that affect decals can be found on the [ [!DNL Texture] tab](../../../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-abt-obj-prop/c-vat-3d-obj-prop/c-vat-3d-flow-obj-prop/c-vat-text-tab-obj.md#concept-81d47c5bdaf64427a222acfee3e6d557) of the [!DNL Object Properties] dialog box.

**To Apply a Decal:** 

1. In [!DNL Photoshop] (or another image editing program), create the decal image, making note of the width, height, and screen resolution settings.
1. Save the decal image as a selection, which makes it a channel.
1. Save the image file in TIFF or PNG format (these formats support channels).
1. On the [!DNL Render] page in [!DNL Image Authoring], in the [ [!DNL Select Object] box](../../../c-vat-gs/c-vat-sel-obj/c-vat-sel-object-box.md#concept-d127c6efaabd436a96c02f36a7bce6ac), select the object on which the decal is to appear, then click the **[!UICONTROL Properties]** button ![](assets/finger.png) just next to it to set the [origin](../../../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-abt-obj-prop/c-vat-3d-obj-prop/c-vat-3d-flow-obj-prop/c-vat-text-tab-obj.md#concept-81d47c5bdaf64427a222acfee3e6d557).

    * Click the **[!UICONTROL Texture]** tab on the [!DNL Object Properties] dialog box. 
    
    * Type new values for the anchor point. 
    * Click **[!UICONTROL OK]**.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Apply New Material]** ![](assets/new_material.png) and choose **[!UICONTROL Apply Decal]**.

   You can also right-click the object and choose **[!UICONTROL Apply Decal]**. 

1. Browse to the decal file you saved in the image editing program and open it.

   The decal is centered on the texture origin.
