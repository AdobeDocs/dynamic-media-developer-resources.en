# Rendering with a Solid Color{#rendering-with-a-solid-color}

You can render an object using a solid color.

This can help you evaluate the illumination for the object and [adjust the [!DNL Illumination Map]](../../c-vat-work-illum-pg/c-vat-work-illum-maps/t-vat-illum-map-img-auth.md#task-0342a45d98cd456aa4e7cbff6a46ca47) until the rendering matches your original image.

**To Render Using a Solid Color:** 

1. Go to the **[!UICONTROL Render]** page by clicking its button ![](assets/render.png).
1. Select the object to render.

   Select an object or group from the [ [!DNL Select Object] box](../../c-vat-gs/c-vat-sel-obj/c-vat-sel-object-box.md#concept-d127c6efaabd436a96c02f36a7bce6ac), or click the object in the image. Click once to select the group. If it has sub-groups, each additional click selects the subordinate group until you reach the object. At that point, additional clicks cycle back until you reach the group level.

   If you use the mouse-click method, check the [!DNL Select Object] box to see what's selected. 

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Apply New Material]** Button ![](assets/new_material.png) and choose **[!UICONTROL Apply Solid Color]**.
1. To select a color, do one of the following:

    * Drag the slider at the right side of the dialog box to change the color family, then select a color by:

      dragging the circle in the large color display or

      clicking the **[!UICONTROL Eyedropper]** and clicking a color anywhere on your screen (in your vignette, in the large color display, or in another application displayed on the screen

      ![](assets/eyedropper.png)

    * Type RGB or HSI values into the boxes provided.

1. To save the active color for future use, right-click one of the small color boxes and choose **[!UICONTROL Set to current color]**.

   If you want to save a custom color for future sessions, add it to the [ [!DNL Favorite Materials] list](../../c-vat-rend-pg/c-vat-rend-tools/c-vat-fav-mat-tool/c-vat-fav-mat-tool.md#concept-5b0d4a25b5ca49129977e1c8bd266370) or the [ [!DNL Saved Materials] list](../../c-vat-rend-pg/c-vat-rend-tools/t-vat-saved-mat-tool/t-vat-saved-mat-tool.md#task-2f7dd900c44e42f4a8e7f41a3003e2fa). 

1. To clear a color from a small color box, right-click the box and choose **[!UICONTROL Clear]**. To clear all the color boxes, choose **[!UICONTROL Clear All]**.
1. When you are finished, click **[!UICONTROL OK]**.
