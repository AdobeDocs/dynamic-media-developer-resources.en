# Cabinet Options{#cabinet-options}

Cabinets can accept cabinet textures (texture files with a .VNC extension) and solid colors.

Cabinets in the [!DNL Illumination Map] must be texture-free in order to render correctly.

If your vignette contains [cabinets with glass doors](../../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-abt-obj-prop/t-vat-cab-glass-doors.md#task-e968ceb7b07644eab2442c4b4737afe7), you must follow a specific set of procedures to be able to render the glass doors properly.

**To Apply a Cabinet Texture to a Cabinet:** 

1. Select a cabinet object or group of cabinets.
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Apply New Material]** button ![](assets/new_material.png) and choose **[!UICONTROL Apply Cabinet]**.
1. Browse to the [!DNL .VNC] file you want to use to render the selected cabinets.

   Unlike other dialog boxes that let you open image files, this dialog box does not support previews. 

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Open]**.
1. To change the properties of the texture, use the [ [!DNL Texture Material Properties]](../../c-vat-rend-pg/c-vat-work-text/c-vat-text-mat-prop/c-vat-text-mat-prop.md#concept-56e919cfd48748169dc2f011aa95c5fd) dialog box.

   If the cabinet layout contains a vertical or horizontal frame, the [!DNL Texture] tab of the [!DNL Cabinet Material Properties] dialog box applies a texture to those frames. 

1. If the cabinet has a glass door, and you have [followed the procedures to make the glass doors renderable](../../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-abt-obj-prop/t-vat-cab-glass-doors.md#task-e968ceb7b07644eab2442c4b4737afe7), right-click the cabinet and choose **[!UICONTROL Show Glass Doors]**.
You can also choose this option from the [!DNL Apply] tab of the [!DNL Material Properties] dialog box.
