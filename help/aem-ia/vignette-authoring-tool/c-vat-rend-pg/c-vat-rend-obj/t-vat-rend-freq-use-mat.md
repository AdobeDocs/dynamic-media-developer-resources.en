# Rendering with Frequently Used Materials{#rendering-with-frequently-used-materials}

If you have a set of custom colors or texture files that you use frequently, you can do any of the following:

* Save colors and textures on the [ [!DNL Saved Materials] list](../../c-vat-rend-pg/c-vat-rend-tools/t-vat-saved-mat-tool/t-vat-saved-mat-tool.md#task-2f7dd900c44e42f4a8e7f41a3003e2fa). Each color or texture is associated with a particular object or group in the current vignette. You can then easily apply saved materials to other objects in your vignette. You can also set up the [!DNL Saved Materials] list to use with [ [!DNL Batch Rendering]](../../c-vat-rend-pg/c-vat-rend-obj/t-vat-batch-rend.md#task-5d1986172ea0426892163cfa54a142a7). (Each [!DNL Saved Materials] list is associated with a particular vignette and is not available universally.) 

* Save textures, colors, cabinet finishes, borders, and decals in the [ [!DNL Favorite Materials] list](../../c-vat-rend-pg/c-vat-rend-tools/c-vat-fav-mat-tool/t-vat-fav-mat-list.md#task-488e210530c24f6bbf7b37d0b6109b61). The textures are saved independent of groups and objects. You can then easily apply saved materials to objects and groups in your vignette. 
* Save textures (but not colors) in the [ [!DNL Material History] list](../../c-vat-rend-pg/c-vat-rend-tools/t-vat-mat-hist-tool.md#task-95e1391588974719bbf93850448d547b). This list is saved automatically when you apply a texture. Cabinet finishes, borders, and decals are included.

**To Apply a Frequently-used Material:** 

1. Select the object or group you want to render with the frequently-used material.
1. Display the appropriate list ( [!DNL Saved Materials] ![](assets/saved_mat.png), [!DNL Favorite Materials] ![](assets/fav_mat.png), or [!DNL Material History] ![](assets/mat_hist.png)) by clicking its tool button in the side menu.
1. Double-click the desired material in the list to apply it to the selected object.
