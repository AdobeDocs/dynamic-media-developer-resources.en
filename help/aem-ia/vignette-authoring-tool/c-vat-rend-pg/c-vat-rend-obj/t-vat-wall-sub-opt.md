# Wall Sub-selection Options{#wall-sub-selection-options}

You can apply different textures and borders to areas of walls that you defined with the Layout tool.

 **To Apply Textures to a Wall:** 

1. Select a wall group or object.
1. Choose any of the following from the Sub-selection drop-down in the side menu area:

    * **Entire Wall - Upper Border: ** Covers the whole wall. Any border you apply displays on top of the top fill. 
    * **Upper Wall - Upper Border:** Choose this when you want to split the wall, with a separate fill on top and bottom. The texture you choose for the wall appears on the upper half of the wall. Any border you apply displays on top of the top fill. 
    * **Lower Wall - Middle Border:** Choose this when you want to split the wall, with a separate fill on top and bottom. The texture you choose for the wall appears on the lower half of the wall. Any border you apply displays in the center border area. 
    * **Lower Wall - Lower Border:** Choose this when you want to split the wall, with a separate fill on top and bottom. The texture you choose for the wall appears on the lower half of the wall. Any border you apply displays in the center border area.

1. [Apply a texture](../../c-vat-rend-pg/c-vat-rend-obj/t-vat-rend-text.md#task-1173f19d98094539906cdde336968712).
1. To apply a border, click the **[!UICONTROL Apply New Material]** Button ![](assets/new_material.png) again and choose **[!UICONTROL Apply Border]**. Navigate to the texture file you want to use as a border, select it, then choose **[!UICONTROL Open]**.

   If areas of the texture file that you are using as a border are defined as transparent, the texture or color of the wall area beneath the border shows through. This is effective for stenciled borders. 

1. If you are applying a wallpaper texture and you want to change the way the wallpaper repeats, or to change other properties of the texture, use the [ [!DNL Texture Material Properties]](../../c-vat-rend-pg/c-vat-work-text/c-vat-text-mat-prop/c-vat-text-mat-prop.md#concept-56e919cfd48748169dc2f011aa95c5fd) dialog box.
