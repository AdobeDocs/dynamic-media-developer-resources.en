# Changing the Texture Anchor Point{#changing-the-texture-anchor-point}

You can change the point on the texture that lines up with the origin on an object.

Unless you are rendering with a heavily patterned fabric texture, you should position the texture anchor point at the top-left corner of the image.

If you want to adjust the way a pattern appears on a particular piece of furniture or apparel, however, you may want to move the anchor point. For example, you might want to apply this pattern to a chair, but instead of centering the flower on the back of the chair, you may want petals at each corner of the chair back:

If you adjust the texture anchor point, make sure you are viewing the correct [origin point in the drop-down list](../../c-vat-flow-pg/c-vat-abt-flow/c-vat-flow-pg-opt.md#concept-ab8e010be60d46c8841f1b00c3501d16).

**To Change the Texture Anchor Point:** 

1. On the [!DNL Render] page, apply the texture you want to adjust to an object or group.
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Material Properties]** tool ![](assets/finger.png), then click the **[!UICONTROL Texture]** tab in the [!DNL Texture Material Properties] dialog box.
1. Reset the texture anchor point by dragging the crosshairs in the preview or by typing new amounts in the [!DNL Anchor Point] boxes.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL OK]** to use the new values.
