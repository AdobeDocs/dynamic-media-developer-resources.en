# Sharpen{#sharpen}

 ** Sharpen:** Set the sharpening for the texture image to none, normal, or more. You must choose normal or more if you want to use the settings on the [!DNL Sharpen] tab of this dialog box. If [!DNL Sharpen] on the [!DNL General] tab is set to none, those settings are ignored.

Choose **[!UICONTROL Unsharp Mask (brightness only)]** or **[!UICONTROL Unsharp Mask (all components)]** to set the following options:

**Unsharp Masking (USM) Amount:** Increases the contrast of pixels in the image. By default this is set to 100%. For high-resolution images, you can increase it to as high as 500%.

**Unsharp Masking (USM) Radius:** Determines the number of pixels surrounding the edge pixels that affect the sharpening. For high-resolution images, set this between 1 and 2. A lower value sharpens only the edge pixels, while a higher value sharpens a wider band of pixels.

**Unsharp Masking (USM) Threshold:** Determines how different the sharpened pixels must be from the surrounding area before they are considered edge pixels and are sharpened. To avoid introducing noise, experiment with values between 2 and 20. The default value of 0 sharpens all pixels in the image.
