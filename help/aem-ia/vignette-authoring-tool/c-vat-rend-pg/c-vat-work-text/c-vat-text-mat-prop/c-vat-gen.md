# General{#general}

 ** Name/ID:** Provide a name for this texture (optional). This name is used by the [!DNL Material History], [!DNL Saved Materials], and [!DNL Favorite Materials] lists.

**Template:** Specifies the [material template](../../../c-vat-rend-pg/c-vat-work-text/t-vat-mat-templ.md#task-8f5d1c397c19469d9ab4fafd2312db83) whose settings are the basis for this material's settings. To create a material template, choose **[!UICONTROL Manage Templates]** at the bottom of this list. To apply a material template, choose it from this list. You can adjust the settings after you apply a template.

**Colorize:** Use this option to change the underlying color for wood grain textures. If several textures of this type use the same image to show the wood grain but have different stains or washes applied to them, you can colorize the wood grain image to show the different stain colors.

**Preferred Illumination Map:** Specify a single [ [!DNL Illumination Map]](../../../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-abt-obj-prop/c-vat-view-prop.md#concept-8a396f7b144c46c4806c8ed26619eed1) to use, or set this option to Auto-Select (which uses the map whose [!DNL Gloss] setting is closest to the one you set on the slider below).

** [Gloss](../../../r-vat-glossary/c-vat-gloss.md#concept-c935eeb0b63442368231fb26b5a58f50):** For vignettes that use reflection or multiple [!DNL Illumination Maps], you can set the material's glossiness. This setting determines which [ [!DNL Illumination Maps]](../../../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-abt-obj-prop/c-vat-view-prop.md#concept-8a396f7b144c46c4806c8ed26619eed1) are used for this object. To use the default gloss setting, move the slider all the way to the left until it reads DEF.

Some materials display more reflection than others, even if they have the same [!DNL Gloss] value. For example, a ceramic material displays more reflection than a glossy fabric.

** Roughness:** For vignettes that use reflection, you can set this material's roughness.

** Opacity:** Set the percentage of opacity for this material.

The texture preview window in this dialog shows how the texture repeats over a square area. The size of that area appears in the box below the preview window. You can change this to see how the texture looks in a larger or smaller area.
