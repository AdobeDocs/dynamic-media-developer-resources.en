# Changing Texture Material Properties{#changing-texture-material-properties}

Use the following options in the [!DNL Texture Material Properties] dialog box to set the properties when rendering texture.

You can display the [!DNL Texture Material Properties] dialog box in any of the following ways:

* Select an object to which you have applied a texture, then click the **[!UICONTROL Properties]** button ![](assets/finger.png) in the [!DNL Render] tool area. 

* Right-click an object to which you have applied a texture and choose [!DNL Material Properties]. 
* Right-click a texture name in the [!DNL Saved Materials], [!DNL Favorite Materials], or [!DNL Material History] lists and choose **[!UICONTROL Properties]**.

When you display the properties for a cabinet object, the dialog box is called [!DNL Cabinet Material Properties]. When you display the properties for a solid color, it is called [!DNL Solid Color Material Properties].

The [!DNL Material Properties] dialog box can have any of the following tabs, depending on the type of texture and the type of object that is selected.
