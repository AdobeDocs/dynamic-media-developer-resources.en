You will see either this tab or the Shader tab, depending on whether you checked Use Alternative Shader on the Illumination tab of the View Properties dialog box.

 **Reset:** Returns the entire palette to its original values.

**Illumination Render Settings: ** You can change the brightness and darkness for your rendered image without changing the [ [!DNL Illumination Map]](../../../c-vat-work-illum-pg/c-vat-abt-illum-pg/c-vat-illum-maps.md#concept-3243a49c92dd4491947481d339d12f3f). This is helpful if some of the materials you are rendering are very bright or very dark and need special illumination considerations that don't affect the image as a whole.

* **Highlights:** Adjusts the brighter pixels to create more realistic highlights for bright colors. 
* **Highlights Saturation:** Adjusts the purity of the highlight color. 
* **Shadows for Bright Materials:** Adjusts the darker pixels to create more realistic highlights for deep colors. 
* **Shadow Saturation:** Adjusts the purity of the shadow color. Move the slider towards the Less end to add more gray and less color. Move the slider towards the More end to add less gray and more color. 
* **Brightness Compensation:** Reduces luminosity for the entire texture. This can be useful for very bright or light colors. 
* **Gloss-Based Extrapolation Strength:** Sets the maximum strength of the gloss effect (the increase in illumination contrast when a material with 100% gloss is applied). Moving the slider all the way to the left disables gloss-effect rendering.
