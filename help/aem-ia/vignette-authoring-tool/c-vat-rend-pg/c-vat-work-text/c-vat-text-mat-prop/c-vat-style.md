# Style File{#style-file}

This tab appears for cabinets, doors, and window coverings only.

The settings display information from the [!DNL .vnc] or [!DNL .vnw] file applied to this object, you cannot change any of them (except the [!DNL File/URL] field).

** File/URL:** Choose a different cabinet or door texture ( [!DNL .vnc]) or window covering ( [!DNL .vnw]) file. You may have to click this button ![](assets/folders.png) and navigate to the folder that contains the file you want.

** Resolution (pix/in):** [Specifies the number of pixels per inch](../../../c-vat-gs/c-vat-abt-res.md#concept-b15c68590bff427599cb0ee380606a0c) of the physical texture.

** Base Color:** Specifies the base color for the selected texture. This is not the base color specified on the [!DNL Texture] tab, but rather any base color specified within this cabinet texture file.

** Texturable Style:** Indicates whether the current cabinet texture file is used to fill all the panels of the cabinet.
