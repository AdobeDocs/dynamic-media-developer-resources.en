# File Info{#file-info}

You cannot change the information on this tab.

It displays the file name of the current texture, its pixel type (bit depth and color space), and any embedded color profile. If the current texture does not have a color profile and was converted, this tab displays the assigned profile. Whichever profile is listed on this tab is used for import and conversion.

For textures you brought in from IPS, the tab also lists the IPS ID, and the URL for the texture that appears instead of its file path.
