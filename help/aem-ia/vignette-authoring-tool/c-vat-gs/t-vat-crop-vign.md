# Cropping a Vignette{#cropping-a-vignette}

You can crop the image before or after authoring.

If you think you might have to crop the image after authoring, don't crop it at all until authoring is complete.

When you crop a vignette, you can also add a solid-fill margin to increase the size of the image. If you cropped the image before you authored it and don't like the results, this is one way to repair it: add a margin, [replace the view image](../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-abt-obj-prop/c-vat-view-prop.md#concept-8a396f7b144c46c4806c8ed26619eed1), and [extend the masks](../c-vat-work-mask-pg/c-vat-create-mask/t-vat-chg-exist-masks.md#task-4ac1ad631df546ea922b0329c7886266).

**To Crop the Vignette:** 

1. From the [!DNL File] menu, choose **[!UICONTROL Crop Vignette]**.
1. In the dialog box, indicate where the crop should occur on the left, right, top, and bottom of the vignette.

   The values indicate the pixel value in the image where the crop takes effect, and not the number of pixels cropped from the image. 

1. If you want to fill the resulting margin with a color, click **[!UICONTROL Margin Fill Color]** and choose a color.

   You can use a custom color for the margin. Click **[!UICONTROL Define Custom Colors]** and [select a color](../c-vat-work-mask-pg/c-vat-abt-mask-pg/c-vat-abt-mask-opt/c-vat-abt-mask-opt.md#concept-1fe40cc1ab864090b95434d610ee5e70). 

1. Click **[!UICONTROL OK]**.
1. In the [!DNL Save As] dialog box, navigate to the folder you want, type a name for the cropped vignette (or accept the default name), then click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
