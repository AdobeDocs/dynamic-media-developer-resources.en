# Selecting and changing objects{#selecting-and-changing-objects}

Use the following techniques to select and change objects:

* To select an object, click the object you want.

The object is defined by its mask area.

On most pages an alt+click cycles through the hierarchy. If it has sub-groups, each additional alt+click drills down and selects a subordinate group until you reach the object. At that point, additional alt+clicks cycle back until you reach the top group level. You can check the [!DNL Select Object] box to see what is selected.

In some situations, you cannot select objects or groups, for example, on the [!DNL Object] page with the [!DNL 3D Import] tool selected. Check the text at the bottom of the window for helpful tips.

You can also use the [ [!DNL Select Object]](../../c-vat-gs/c-vat-sel-obj/c-vat-sel-object-box.md#concept-d127c6efaabd436a96c02f36a7bce6ac) box to select objects.

* To see or change the properties for an object, double-click the object name in the [ [!DNL Object Explorer]](../../r-vat-glossary/c-vat-obj-explorer.md#concept-da56038ea82c40a1a10576f99f2f6836) or click the **[!UICONTROL Properties]** button ![](assets/finger.png) next to the [ [!DNL Select Object]](../../c-vat-gs/c-vat-sel-obj/c-vat-sel-object-box.md#concept-d127c6efaabd436a96c02f36a7bce6ac) box. If you hold down the Ctrl key when you click ![](assets/finger.png), you see the [ [!DNL View] properties](../../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-abt-obj-prop/c-vat-view-prop.md#concept-8a396f7b144c46c4806c8ed26619eed1). If you hold down the Shift key when you click ![](assets/finger.png), you see the [ [!DNL Vignette] properties](../../c-vat-gs/t-vat-create-vign.md#task-a51b7fb4cce14ea88279116b24cc98b4).
