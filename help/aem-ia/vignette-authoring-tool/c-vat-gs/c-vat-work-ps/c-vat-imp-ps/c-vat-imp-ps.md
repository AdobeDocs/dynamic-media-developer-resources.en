You can import the following (collectively) from a PSD file:

* ** [The View Image:](../../../c-vat-gs/c-vat-work-ps/t-vat-prep-img-ps.md#task-f796b659745740028b561d61ab9823ea) ** The photograph to be authored. 
* **Shared Illumination Maps:** If you create an illumination profile (an [!DNL .amp] file) using the [!DNL Curves] tool in [!DNL Photoshop], you can [load and use that profile in [!DNL Image Authoring]](../../../c-vat-work-illum-pg/c-vat-illum-pg-tools/c-vat-histo-tool/c-vat-histo-tool.md#concept-bee364575d6d49c4a00a3f6609550f24). 

* **Object Masks:** Masks are passed as channels in the PSD. The other items are passed as layers. 
* **RGBA Images:** For [static overlap objects](../../../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-create-grps-obj/t-vat-overlap-obj.md#task-444f7cb2256040a48ba41ce380348465).
