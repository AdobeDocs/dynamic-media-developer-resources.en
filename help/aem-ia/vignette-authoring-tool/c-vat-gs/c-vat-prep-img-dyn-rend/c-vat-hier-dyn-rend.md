# Designing a Hierarchy for Dynamic Rendering{#designing-a-hierarchy-for-dynamic-rendering}

You create the vignette hierarchy on the Object page.

Follow these guidelines when you create an object hierarchy for your vignette:

* If your website lets the end-user decorate separate areas of the vignette, you and your Web developers must agree on a consistent naming convention for objects and groups. The Web code refers to groups and sub-groups within the vignette, and the code and the vignette hierarchy must match. 
* Be sure to use the identical spelling and capitalization for object types. For example, if you name an object group "couch," don't ever name its objects "Couch." 
* Be sure to use consistent and appropriate object types for object groups. For example, if you need to create flowlines for a couch object, create that object as a [!DNL Flowline] object. If you create one couch as a [!DNL Flowline] object, create all couches using [!DNL Flowline] object types.

One way to ensure that all these guidelines are followed is to use [vignette templates](../../c-vat-gs/t-vat-vign-temp.md#task-0fcd55117eb947808d402cefa8df0c3a).
