# Opening a Vignette{#opening-a-vignette}

Once you've saved a vignette, you can open it in any several ways.

 **To Open a Vignette:**

* Click ![](assets/folder.png) to display a dialog box where you can open vignette and image files. Specify the location, name, and file type, then click **[!UICONTROL Open]**. 

* Choose [!DNL Open from the File] menu and follow the same steps as above.

The [!DNL Open] dialog box displays a preview of the vignette, if one is available and you [turned on the preview preference](../c-vat-img-auth-opt/t-vat-prev-img.md#task-f2c5deb580cb465ebe19f4415bcca037). When you save a vignette in version 3.0 or higher, [!DNL Image Authoring] automatically creates a thumbnail that it uses for this preview.

* Drag a vignette filename from Windows Explorer into the [!DNL Image Authoring]window. 
* You can drag and drop a vignette from IPS onto [!DNL Image Authoring]. To do this, simply browse the vignettes folder in IPS and drag the image of a vignette from the browser onto Image Authoring. Drag and drop operations must be done from the [!DNL Browse Page] of IPS.

If you are connecting to an enterprise edition of IPS, then your [!DNL Preferences] for IPS must be set to connect to that server. For example, the user name and password must be valid for the company you wish to access.
