# The Pick tool{#the-pick-tool}

The Pick tool lets you select a plane you've defined and add extrusions or define the scale of a particular line.

Once you select this tool, you remain in [!DNL Pick] mode until you click a non-defined area (or the area outside the image).

**To create an extrusion** 

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Pick]** tool ![](assets/pick.png).
1. Click a defined plane to select it.
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Add]** tool ![](assets/add.png).
1. [Use the [!DNL Add] tool](../../c-vat-3d-mod-pg/c-vat-create-geo/t-vat-add-geo.md#task-21871477506a4daaa695d638cc159dc0) to build an object perpendicular to the selected plane.
1. Hold down the Alt key and drag the selected plane to see the extrusions in 3D.
**To define scale**

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Pick]** tool ![](assets/pick.png). 

1. Click a line segment within a defined plane to select it.

   The line segment thickens and turns red when the cursor is over it. 
1. Define the length of real-life version of this segment (in inches) by typing a value in the [!DNL Selected Length] field and clicking **[!UICONTROL Reset]**.

   For example, if the segment represents a wall, type 96 to indicate that the wall is eight feet (or 96 inches) tall. If you are not sure of the real-life size of the objects in your photo, use a kitchen counter height (almost always 36 inches) or a wall (almost always 96 inches).
