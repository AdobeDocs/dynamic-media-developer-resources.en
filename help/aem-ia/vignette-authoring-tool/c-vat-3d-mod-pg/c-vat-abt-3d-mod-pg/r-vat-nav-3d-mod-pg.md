# Navigating in the 3D Modeling Page{#navigating-in-the-d-modeling-page}

You can zoom, pan, and rotate the 3D Modeling page view.

|  To do this  | Press this  |
|---|---|
|  Zoom  | Hold down the Ctrl and Alt keys while you drag the mouse forward (to zoom out) or back (to zoom in). When the [!DNL Rotate] tool is selected, hold down the Ctrl key to zoom.  |
|  Pan  | Hold down the Shift and Alt keys while you drag the mouse in the direction you want to pan. When the [!DNL Rotate] tool is selected, you don't need to hold down any keys to pan.  |
|  Rotate (after you build the geometry)  | With the [!DNL Rotate] tool selected, just drag to rotate. For all other tools (except [!DNL Camera]) hold down the Alt key while you drag the mouse. Rotation is not available when the [!DNL Camera] tool is active.  |
|  Return to the original view after you've zoomed, panned, and/or rotated.  | Click the [!DNL Home] button at the bottom of the side window.  |
