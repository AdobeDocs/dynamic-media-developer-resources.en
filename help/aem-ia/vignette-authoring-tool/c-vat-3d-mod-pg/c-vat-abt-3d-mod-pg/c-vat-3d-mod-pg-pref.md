# 3D Modeling Page Preferences{#d-modeling-page-preferences}

The 3D Modeling page preferences (available from Preferences on the Edit menu) let you turn display options on or off.

These settings affect the [!DNL 3D Modeling] page only. Because the work on this page requires a lot of computer processing, it may be helpful to display less information about the image while you set up your geometry.

The [!DNL 3D Modeling page] has the following preferences:

* **Use [!DNL OpenGL] for All Graphics (Slower):** When this setting is checked, [!DNL Image Authoring] uses [!DNL OpenGL] (if your graphics card supports it). Display is smoother, but performance may be slower. 

* **Display Image in Full Resolution (Slower):** When this setting is checked, [!DNL Image Authoring] redraws the image for every zoom and pan increment, giving you more detail. Uncheck this setting to improve performance in zooming and panning.
