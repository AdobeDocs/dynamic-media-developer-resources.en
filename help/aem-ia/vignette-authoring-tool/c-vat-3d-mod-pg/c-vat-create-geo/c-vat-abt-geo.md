# About Geometry{#about-geometry}

You may want to use 3D modeling geometry if your vignette contains flat, reflective, hard surfaces.

For example, geometry is useful for bathroom or kitchen scenes. Geometry lets you render the scene with realistic reflections. For example, when a user changes the color of a vase on a countertop, the reflection of the vase on the counter changes color, too.

3D modeling is also useful for other room scenes, such as living rooms and bedrooms. Once you set up the geometry, all the textures you apply scale to the correct size automatically.

To create geometry successfully, complete the following steps in order, saving your work as you go along:
