# Defining Scale for 3D Images{#defining-scale-for-d-images}

Image Authoring uses the Pick tool measurement, along with the other geometry information you've defined, to size all the objects in the vignette.

The [!DNL Pick] tool ![](assets/pick.png) lets you specify the length of an edge of a plane you've defined. You need define only one line length.

The [!DNL Pick] tool also lets you check the length of any edge based on the current scale, this serves as a useful consistency check.

Once you select this tool, you remain in [!DNL Pick] mode until you click a non-defined area (or the area outside the image).

**To Define Scale:** 

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Pick]** tool ![](assets/pick.png).
1. Click a line segment within a defined plane to select it.

   The line segment thickens and turns red when the cursor is over it.

1. Define the length of the real-life version of this segment (in inches) by typing a value in the [!DNL Selected Length] field and clicking **[!UICONTROL Reset]**.

   For example, if the segment represents a wall, type 96 to indicate that the wall is eight feet (or 96 inches) tall. If you are not sure of the real-life size of the objects in your photo, use a kitchen counter height (almost always 36 inches) or a wall (almost always 96 inches). 

Once you have defined the scale, you can [import your geometry](../../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-abt-obj-pg/t-vat-imp-geo.md#task-a6681c3260ee4a57a177366095981ddc) and save it with your vignette. You can return to the [!DNL 3D Modeling] page at any time to add or modify geometry.

To successfully create geometry, complete the following steps, in order:
