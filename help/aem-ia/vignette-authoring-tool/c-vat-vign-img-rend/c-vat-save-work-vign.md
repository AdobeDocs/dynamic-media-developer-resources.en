# Saving Your Work{#saving-your-work}

Save your work frequently.

When you first begin, you may want to rename each saved version at intervals, so you can go back to a particular version if you don't like subsequent changes.

**To Save Your Vignette:**

* Choose **[!UICONTROL Save]** or **[!UICONTROL Save As]** from the [!DNL File] menu.

The Save command overwrites the existing version of your vignette with your most recent changes. The Save As command lets you save the new version with a different name or in a different location.

The Save command saves vignettes in the [!DNL .VNT] format. To save in a different format, use the [Export](../c-vat-vign-img-rend/t-vat-exp-vign-img-file.md#task-18c83bf6c1ff4c879fc87939835c3e44) command. Exporting an image saves only the currently displayed image, not the vignette and all of its items.

When you have saved the final versions of your vignettes, you can [prepare them for the image rendering system](../c-vat-gs/c-vat-prep-img-dyn-rend/c-vat-img-rend-sys/c-vat-abt-vign-update-tool.md#concept-61c09096c9384766b30097c814780780).
