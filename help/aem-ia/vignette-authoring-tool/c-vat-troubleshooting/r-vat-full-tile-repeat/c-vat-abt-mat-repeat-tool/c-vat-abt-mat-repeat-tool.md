# About the Material Repeat tool{#about-the-material-repeat-tool}

The Material Repeat tool is a Photoshop plug-in you can use to create a full-tile repeat.

If you have [!DNL Photoshop], the [!DNL Material Repeat] tool is installed when you install [!DNL Image Authoring]. The [!DNL Material Repeat] tool can help you to do the following:

* [Adjust for perspective distortion](../../../c-vat-troubleshooting/r-vat-imperfections/t-vat-use-persp-tab.md#task-e2f78478db0f43c080a847b8c882062c) (when the sample was not photographed parallel to the camera's image plane and, as a result, parallel lines in the sample are not parallel in the image). 
* [Remove gradients caused by uneven lighting](../../../c-vat-troubleshooting/r-vat-imperfections/t-vat-use-lighting-tab/t-vat-use-lighting-tab.md#task-698a9179d4924d4880bf6b8fa7ba2981) (when illumination varies across the image and, as a result, the opposite edges of the image don't match in brightness or saturation). 
* [Create a tile that uses a half-drop or half-across repeat](../../../c-vat-troubleshooting/r-vat-imperfections/t-vat-use-lighting-tab/t-vat-create-final-repeat.md#task-f33d6792ef9647eb828822c7d1624719).

The [!DNL Material Repeat] tool has its own [!DNL Zoom In] and [!DNL Zoom Out] buttons to control its display. You can [change some aspects](../../../c-vat-troubleshooting/r-vat-full-tile-repeat/c-vat-abt-mat-repeat-tool/t-vat-chg-mat-repeat-tool-opts.md#task-dce9301fd1284562a754c5a5c8aeaf53) of the appearance and behavior of the tool.
