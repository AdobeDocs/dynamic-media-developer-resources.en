# Changing Material Repeat tool options{#changing-material-repeat-tool-options}

You can change the appearance and behavior of some items in the Material Repeat tool.

 ** To change Material Repeat tool options** 

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Options]** at the bottom of the [!DNL Material Repeat] tool.
1. Change any of the following options:

    * Choose a [!DNL Resampling Method]. Generally, [!DNL Nearest Neighbor] is fastest and gives the sharpest result, but textures that use a regular, finely detailed pattern may display better using Bi-Linear filtering. 
    
    * Under [!DNL Auto-Repeat Detection], change the values to improve pattern matching. The weights you specify should match the dominant values for the texture. For example, set the Hue Weight to 0 for a monochrome pattern. Change the [!DNL Distance Tolerance] value to match your texture. Use a larger value for patterns with large uniform areas and a smaller value for patterns with a lot of detail. 
    
    * Click a selection under [!DNL Line Color] to change the color of the lines that overlay the texture image. 
    * Click a selection under [!DNL Point/Tangent Color] to change the color of handles and points. 
    * Check the **[!UICONTROL Use Xor Draw Mode]** option to improve performance on some systems.

1. When you are finished, click **[!UICONTROL OK]**.
