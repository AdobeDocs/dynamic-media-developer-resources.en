# Identifying the full repeat{#identifying-the-full-repeat}

The term full repeat is commonly used in the wall covering and fabric industries.

This space can vary in size, style, and color, but it is always rectangular.

The [!DNL Material Repeat] tool deals with two types of repeats-half-drop and half-across:

* A half-drop repeat pushes the first fully visible row of fill textures down halfway. This can be useful when a border covering the fill texture is half the size of the texture. 
* A half-across repeat pushes the first fully visible row of fill textures across halfway. This can be useful when a texture imitates a brick pattern, with the bricks overlapping by half their width.

A full repeat lets you accurately offset the image to repeat both horizontally and vertically without a seam line. You can then use this full repeat as the sample fabric for rendering in [!DNL Image Authoring].

Start by visually identifying the repeat on your texture sample, then [scanning](../../c-vat-troubleshooting/r-vat-full-tile-repeat/c-vat-full-repeat-patt.md#concept-e060f8a792a84e65996fafca989ee147) or [photographing](../../c-vat-troubleshooting/r-vat-full-tile-repeat/c-vat-text-imgs-dig-cam.md#concept-d721159afdbe41a59889e7cbd7c39d2e) the repeat.
