# Scanning the pattern for the full repeat{#scanning-the-pattern-for-the-full-repeat}

If your image fits onto a scanner bed, follow these recommendations to achieve the best scanning results.

If the image does not fit on a scanner bed, [use a digital camera](../../c-vat-troubleshooting/r-vat-full-tile-repeat/c-vat-text-imgs-dig-cam.md#concept-d721159afdbe41a59889e7cbd7c39d2e) to capture it.

**General**

* Pre-scan the image you want to use for your full repeat. 
* Make sure that the image is straight on the scanner bed, and not wrinkled or folded. 
* Scan the image slightly larger than the repeat on the fabric/wallpaper, so you have plenty of room to skew, transform, or move the fabric. 
* Be sure that the fabric has both a horizontal and a vertical repeat. 
* A square repeat is the only way to ensure that the fabric will tile out properly.

**Screen Resolution**

* If the repeat on a fabric or wall covering is smaller than Â½ inch, or if the fabric or wallpaper is highly textured, scan it at 68 ppi to help identify the object in the scan. 
* For objects with a small repeat or a fine texture, use a higher resolution scan for greater clarity. 
* For all other images, scan at 34 ppi.

** Canvas Size**

* The final full-tile repeat should be one full repeat horizontally and vertically. 
* If your pattern is very small, however, you must capture multiple repeats. As a rule of thumb, make your full-tile repeat approximately one foot square.
