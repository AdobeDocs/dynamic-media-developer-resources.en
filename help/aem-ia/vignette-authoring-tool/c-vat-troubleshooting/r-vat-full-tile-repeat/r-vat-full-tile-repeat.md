# Creating a Full-Tile Repeat{#creating-a-full-tile-repeat}

If you want to create a texture file for use with Image Authoring, and that texture has a repeating pattern, you must create a texture file that constitutes a full-tile repeat.

This means that when the texture file is tiled, or repeatedly rendered on an object, all the edges of the pattern join seamlessly.

This process is divided into the following sections:
