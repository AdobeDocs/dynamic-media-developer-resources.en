# Questions About the Reflection Page{#questions-about-the-reflection-page}

## Do I need to create reflection for every vignette? {#do-i-need-to-create-reflection-for-every-vignette}

You do not need to create reflection for vignettes featuring apparel, linen, or single objects. Create a [!DNL Reflection Map] only if your vignette shows a three-dimensional scene containing reflective surfaces such as floors or countertops.

## When should I create my Reflection Map? {#when-should-i-create-my-reflection-map}

Generate the [!DNL Reflection Map] after you've completed all the vignette steps except rendering. If you render your image after creating a [!DNL Reflection Map], the rendering shows you the reflections.

## What is the Alpha Map? {#what-is-the-alpha-map}

The [!DNL Alpha Map] determines the reflection strength. Brighter regions have stronger, sharper reflections, while darker regions have weaker, more diffused reflections. The [!DNL Alpha Map] shows bright and dark areas of the [!DNL Reflection Map]. [!DNL Image Authoring] creates a default [!DNL Alpha Map] when you use the [ [!DNL Map] tool](../c-vat-refl-pg/c-vat-use-refl-tools/c-vat-refl-map-tool.md#concept-fc4781136f994df6b11654c993a7a506). You can adjust the [!DNL Alpha Map], if you like.
