# Fixing Smudges, Tears, Spots, and Holes{#fixing-smudges-tears-spots-and-holes}

Use the Rubber Stamp tool in Photoshop to fix smudges, tears, spots, holes, and so forth.

The [!DNL Rubber Stamp] paints one part of a canvas to match another part. This works better than cut and paste, because it lets you choose the ideal brush size for your specific patch job.

Use an [!DNL Opacity] setting of 100% to get a full spot sample and an accurate replication.

**To Adjust the Opacity for the Rubber Stamp Tool:**

1. Select the [!DNL Rubber Stamp] tool from the toolbar. 
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Window]** > **[!UICONTROL Show Options]**. 

1. Adjust the tool to stamp at 100%.

Use a soft brush to blend into a seamed area that may require more delicacy. The brush size you use depends on the size and area you are modifying. Smaller brushes are usually more useful for patching smaller areas.

**To Make a Brush Softer:**

1. Double-click a brush in the [!DNL Brushes] pallet. 
1. Adjust the Hardness.

   The softest brush is 1 and the hardest one is 100.

**To Use the Rubber Stamp Tool:**

1. Select the [!DNL Rubber Stamp] icon on the tool bar. 
1. Position the pointer on the part of any open image that you want to use as your patch for another image. 
1. Hold down the Alt key and click.

   Your brush duplicates this point and paints it onto the area you need to patch. 
1. Move the cursor to the portion of the image that you need to patch. 
1. Drag onto the place you want to alter.

   The brush that you selected will begin painting the duplication.

If you have a half-drop repeat, you can use the [!DNL Rubber Stamp] to create the full repeat. The [!DNL Make Tile] tool quickly makes full repeats from a completed repeat.

**To Create a Full Repeat from a Half-Drop Repeat:**

1. Select the [!DNL Rubber Stamp] tool from the toolbar. 
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Window]** > **[!UICONTROL Show Options]**. 

1. Adjust the tool to stamp at 100%. 
1. Select **[!UICONTROL Aligned]** to apply the patch to an entire sampled area at once, regardless of how many times you stop and resume painting.

   This option is useful when you want to use different sized brushes to paint an image with the same patch sample. 

1. Hold down the Alt key and sample a patch that is common both horizontally and in the middle of the image.

   If a horizontal repeat is not present but a vertical repeat is, use the vertical common points to stamp out horizontally. 
1. Release the Alt key and stamp to the coordinating center point with the mouse.
