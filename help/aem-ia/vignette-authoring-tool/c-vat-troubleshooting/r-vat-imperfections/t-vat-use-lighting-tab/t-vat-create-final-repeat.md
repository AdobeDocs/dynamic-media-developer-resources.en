# Creating the Final Repeat{#creating-the-final-repeat}

The Lighting tab lets you view multiple tiles to make sure that the pattern repeats properly.

 **To create the final repeat** 

1. Check the **[!UICONTROL Highlight Tile Edges]** checkbox to see how the pattern tiles.
1. Uncheck **[!UICONTROL Highlight Tile Edges]** and zoom in to check the corners of the repeat.
1. If the repeated items in the pattern don't match at the corners, use the [ [!DNL Perspective] tab](../../../c-vat-troubleshooting/r-vat-imperfections/t-vat-use-persp-tab.md#task-e2f78478db0f43c080a847b8c882062c) to redefine the edges of the repeat.
1. If a gradient is apparent in the tiled pattern, use the [ [!DNL Lighting] tab](../../../c-vat-troubleshooting/r-vat-imperfections/t-vat-use-lighting-tab/t-vat-use-lighting-tab.md#task-698a9179d4924d4880bf6b8fa7ba2981) to correct it.
1. When the repeat is final, click the **[!UICONTROL Finish]** button on the [!DNL Lighting] tab.

   The [!DNL Material Repeat] tool saves your changes to the image file and closes, leaving the image open in [!DNL Photoshop].
