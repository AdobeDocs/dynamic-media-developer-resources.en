You may need to make considerable adjustments to brightness and contrast to achieve correct color.

All instructions are for [!DNL Photoshop].

1. From the [!DNL Image] menu, choose **[!UICONTROL Adjust]** > **[!UICONTROL Brightness/Contrast]**.
1. To test the tool, enter a value of +15 for Brightness and +15 for Contrast.

   Dragging to the left decreases the level and to the right increases it. Do this until a considerable adjustment has been made through the [!DNL Brightness/Contrast] tool.
