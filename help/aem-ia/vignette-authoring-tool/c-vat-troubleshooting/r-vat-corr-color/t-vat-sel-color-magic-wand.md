# Selecting a Color with a Magic Wand Tool{#selecting-a-color-with-a-magic-wand-tool}

Although the Hue/Saturation command lets you select specific color tones, it is not always the best way to fix the color on an image.

Sometimes it is necessary to select the color to be fixed with the [!DNL Magic Wand] tool. It selects a consistently colored area (for example, a red flower), without your having to select that area.

After you use the [!DNL Magic Wand] to select a colored area, use the [!DNL Similar] command to find all other portions of the canvas with that color. Adjust the [!DNL Tolerance] option (on the [!DNL Magic Wand] option palette) to broaden or narrow the number of shades of that color that the [!DNL Similar] command recognizes.

Check the [!DNL Anti-alias] option when you select around a smooth edge. Anti-aliasing softens the edge and makes the tolerance less sensitive.

**To Adjust the Unmasked Area Without Adjusting the Rest of the Image:** 

1. Click on the unmasked area with the [!DNL Magic Wand] to highlight the area with the background color.
1. Adjust the [!DNL Tolerance] by double-clicking the [!DNL Magic Wand] tool.

   Increasing the tolerance level increases the number of shades the wand selects.
