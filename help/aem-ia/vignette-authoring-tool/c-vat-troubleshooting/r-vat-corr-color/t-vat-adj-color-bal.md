# Adjusting Color Balance{#adjusting-color-balance}

Use the Color Balance dialog box to adjust individual colors.

All instructions are for [!DNL Photoshop].

** To Adjust Color Balance:** 

1. From the [!DNL Select] menu, choose **[!UICONTROL All]**.
1. From the [!DNL Image] menu, choose **[!UICONTROL Adjust]** > **[!UICONTROL Color Balance]**.
1. Choose **[!UICONTROL Shadows]**, **[!UICONTROL Midtones]**, or **[!UICONTROL Highlights]** to specify the tone to adjust.
1. Drag the sliders to adjust individual colors.
For your reference, these colors are as follows: 

|  Cyan  | Red  |
|---|---|
|  Yellow  | Blue  |
|  Magenta  | Green  |

Drag toward the color you want to increase in the image. Drag away from the color you want to decrease in the image.

By decreasing one color, you increase its opposite. To eliminate this effect, take color away using the [Hue/Saturation](../../c-vat-troubleshooting/r-vat-corr-color/t-vat-adj-hue-sat.md#task-55c27df0aa714eba88f75feaf45455fa) filter.
