# Correcting Color{#correcting-color}

When you create a sample for use in rendering, try to match the color of the computer image with the actual sample.

Follow these recommendations, if you can:

* Color-calibrate your monitor with hardware and software devices and [choose a monitor profile](../../c-vat-img-auth-opt/t-vat-color-pref.md#task-b73fd4722e9247e8bce1f5a70518c33d). 
* Take time to experiment with the [!DNL Photoshop] tools described here, especially at their lowest and highest levels, to understand how each one interacts with the image. 
* Make sure to have the actual fabric or wallpaper available during this exercise, as your corrections are made with reference to the original.

This process is divided into the following sections:

* [Adjusting Brightness and Contrast](../../c-vat-troubleshooting/r-vat-corr-color/t-vat-adj-bright-contrast.md#task-87a0efe8c9344f7fb062ada0cc9722e3) 
* [Adjusting Hue and Saturation](../../c-vat-troubleshooting/r-vat-corr-color/t-vat-adj-hue-sat.md#task-55c27df0aa714eba88f75feaf45455fa) 
* [Adjusting Color Balance](../../c-vat-troubleshooting/r-vat-corr-color/t-vat-adj-color-bal.md#task-0d416950e48f4eafb0c73685f1a3bdaf) 
* [Selecting a Color with a Magic Wand Tool](../../c-vat-troubleshooting/r-vat-corr-color/t-vat-sel-color-magic-wand.md#task-6c30bb05131f4148bc3f196c12498d03)
