# Adjusting Hue and Saturation{#adjusting-hue-and-saturation}

The Hue/Saturation command lets you adjust the hue, saturation, and lightness of individual color components in an image.

Use it to take whatever color information is already present in the image and alter it to make the image look more realistic.

Hue represents the color and Saturation represents the purity of this color. A small change can make a large impact on your image.

All instructions are for [!DNL Photoshop].

**To Adjust Hue and Saturation:** 

1. From the [!DNL Select] menu, choose **[!UICONTROL All]**.
1. From the [!DNL Image] menu, choose **[!UICONTROL Adjust]** > **[!UICONTROL Hue/Saturation]**.
1. Make your adjustments and click **[!UICONTROL OK]**.
