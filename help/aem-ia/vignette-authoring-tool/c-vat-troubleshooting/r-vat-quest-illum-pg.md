# Questions About the Illumination Page{#questions-about-the-illumination-page}

## How do I create an Illumination Map? {#how-do-i-create-an-illumination-map}

[!DNL Image Authoring] creates an [!DNL Illumination Map] automatically when you create a vignette. You can adjust the [!DNL Illumination Map] for a group, sub-group, or object. You can [copy the [!DNL Illumination Map] and adjust it](../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-abt-obj-prop/c-vat-view-prop.md#concept-8a396f7b144c46c4806c8ed26619eed1) to use multiple [!DNL Illumination Maps].

You can also adjust the [!DNL Illumination Map] for the unmasked area before you mask objects to affect the entire vignette. Once you mask the objects within the vignette, adjusting the [!DNL Illumination Map] for the unmasked area changes only the unmasked area's [!DNL Illumination Map] and does not affect any masked objects.

## Should I create my Illumination Map within Image Authoring or import a map created externally? {#should-i-create-my-illumination-map-within-image-authoring-or-import-a-map-created-externally}

If you are familiar with a third-party graphics tool such as [!DNL Photoshop], you may want to create the map there, then import it into [!DNL Image Authoring]. [!DNL Photoshop] offers a wider and more flexible range of tools than [!DNL Image Authoring] does. However, you may find that doing it in [!DNL Image Authoring] works fine for you. Your best bet is to try it both ways, then determine which method you prefer.

## When I create an Illumination Map, how much should I brighten it? {#when-i-create-an-illumination-map-how-much-should-i-brighten-it}

This comes with experience. A good rule of thumb is to start with something in the middle, not too dark and not too bright. You can adjust the [!DNL Illumination Map] during the authoring process.

## How do I delete an Illumination Map? {#how-do-i-delete-an-illumination-map}

This can be done from the [!DNL Object] page.
