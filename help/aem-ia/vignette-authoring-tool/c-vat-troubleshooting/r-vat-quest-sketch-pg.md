# Questions About the Sketch Page{#questions-about-the-sketch-page}

## Do I need to create Sketch features for every vignette? {#do-i-need-to-create-sketch-features-for-every-vignette}

If your vignette contains no [!DNL Sketch] objects, you don't need to create [!DNL Sketch] features. Generally, you use [!DNL Sketch] features for apparel and linens.

## Does it matter in which direction I draw a Sketch feature? {#does-it-matter-in-which-direction-i-draw-a-sketch-feature}

If you are drawing a [!DNL Warp] or [!DNL Weft] feature, make sure you draw in the same direction as the texture direction, as this affects texture rendering.

## I'm trying to edit a feature but I can't see the tangent handles. {#i-m-trying-to-edit-a-feature-but-i-can-t-see-the-tangent-handles}

If you can't see the tangent handles, check the [!DNL Show Tangent Handles] option. If you still cannot see the tangent handles, they may be hidden behind the vertex. Zoom in on the vertex to see them.

## When I'm using the Texture tool to set the selected feature length, how can I tell which feature is selected? {#when-i-m-using-the-texture-tool-to-set-the-selected-feature-length-how-can-i-tell-which-feature-is-selected}

The pointer changes to an exclamation point when you position the mouse over the selected feature.
