# Viewing Masks{#viewing-masks}

You can switch between viewing a masked object and the unmasked area of a vignette.

Unmasked objects are not rendered. You can also quickly switch back and forth between viewing the current masked object and the previous one you viewed.

**To View the Unmasked Area:** 

1. On the [!DNL Mask] page, right-click any masked object.
1. Choose **[!UICONTROL Select Unmasked]**.

   [If you renamed the unmasked object](../../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-abt-obj-pg/c-vat-abt-obj-pg.md#concept-0c58b45999ce4d74aecd09ea0d5c5263) for your vignette, this command uses the new name, rather than [!DNL Unmasked]. 

**To See the Previously-selected Masked Object:**

1. On the [!DNL Mask] page, right-click any masked object. 
1. Choose **[!UICONTROL Select Previous]**.
