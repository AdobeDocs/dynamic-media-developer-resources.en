# Importing a Mask{#importing-a-mask}

If you have created a Photoshop image that uses channels for masks, you can import the channels from that .psd file and convert them into Image Authoring masked objects.

Do this before creating any masks in [!DNL Image Authoring], but after you create objects on the [!DNL Object] page.

**To Import a Mask:** 

1. In the toolbar, click ![](assets/finger.png).
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Mask]** tab.
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Load]**, and specify the mask file to import.
1. On the [!DNL Mask Page] ![](assets/mask.png), in the side menu, click the **[!UICONTROL Resync]** button.
