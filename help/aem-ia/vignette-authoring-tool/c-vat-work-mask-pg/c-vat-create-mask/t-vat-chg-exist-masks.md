# Changing Existing Masks{#changing-existing-masks}

When you first create a mask, you are adding it to the photo.

**To Add to the Mask:** 

1. In the side menu, select **[!UICONTROL Add]**.
1. Draw a mask outline around the area you want to add.
1. In the side menu, click **[!UICONTROL Apply]**.
** To Remove an Area from the Mask:**

1. In the side menu, select **[!UICONTROL Subtract]**. 
1. Draw a mask outline around the area you want to remove. 
1. In the side menu, click **[!UICONTROL Apply]**.
