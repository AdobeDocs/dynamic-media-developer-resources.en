# The Mask Brush{#the-mask-brush}

The Mask Brush lets you paint a mask onto an object.

Since the brush is round, this can be useful when you need a perfectly round mask. You may also find it handy for touching up masks that contain some rounded edges.

The [!DNL Mask Brush] has the following option:

* Opacity lets you mask areas translucently. The [!DNL Opacity] range is 0 to 100%, with 100% (the default) being completely opaque.

You can use [!DNL Opacity] to mask an object that is seen through a transparent or translucent area, such as a wall seen through transparent drapes or a couch behind a glass table. You use [!DNL Opacity] when you [define the mask for a highlight matte object](../../c-vat-work-mask-pg/c-vat-create-mask/t-vat-edge-recog-masks.md#task-4fe94280df4848baae7f6c417890022a).

When you move the opacity slider below 100%, you cannot use the Add and Subtract settings.

**To Use the Mask Brush:**

1. In the [ [!DNL Select Object] box](../../c-vat-gs/c-vat-sel-obj/c-vat-sel-object-box.md#concept-d127c6efaabd436a96c02f36a7bce6ac) in the toolbar, select the object. 
1. In the side menu toolbar, click **[!UICONTROL Add]**. 
1. Click the [!DNL Mask Brush] tool ![](assets/mask_brush.png). 

1. Paint the edges of the mask with the [!DNL Mask Brush] tool to round its edges.

**To Change the Brush Size:**

* Drag the [!DNL Brush Size] slider to the right (larger) or left (smaller) or use the square bracket [ and ] keys on your keyboard to make the brush size smaller or larger.

**To Change the Brush Edge:**

* Drag the [!DNL Brush Edge] slider to the right for a sharper edge or to the left for a fuzzier edge.
