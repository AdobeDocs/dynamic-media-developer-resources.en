# Creating a Feature{#creating-a-feature}

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Sketch Page]** button ![](assets/sketch_button.png) to see the [!DNL Sketch] page (if it isn't already displayed).
1. Make sure the [!DNL Sketch] object you want is selected in the [ [!DNL Select Object] box](../../c-vat-gs/c-vat-sel-obj/c-vat-sel-object-box.md#concept-d127c6efaabd436a96c02f36a7bce6ac).

   You must choose a [!DNL Sketch] object. If the object you want to add sketch features to is not a [!DNL Sketch] object, [change its object type](../../c-vat-obj-pg/c-vat-work-obj/t-vat-chg-obj-type.md#task-ce743f3c8ab74682abd1841e340a9e66). 

1. Make sure the [object mask](../../c-vat-work-mask-pg/c-vat-create-mask/t-vat-add-mask.md#task-f8d4ae100d834ace9f90f7f260bf15aa) is complete.
1. Make sure [illumination](../../c-vat-work-illum-pg/c-vat-work-illum-maps/t-vat-illum-map-img-auth.md#task-0342a45d98cd456aa4e7cbff6a46ca47) is set for the object.
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Add Feature]** tool ![](assets/add_feature.png).
1. Choose the [ [!DNL Feature Type]](../../c-vat-work-sketch-pg/r-vat-create-sketch-feat/r-vat-create-sketch-feat.md#reference-b7085135ac07423293bf9014bfebf461).
1. Position the cursor over the origin for this feature.

   If you are drawing a [!DNL Warp] or [!DNL Weft] feature, make sure you draw in the same direction as the texture direction, as this affects texture rendering.

   If you are drawing a [!DNL Horizon Edge] or [!DNL Hidden Area] feature, you may want to turn on the [!DNL Snap To Mask Edges] option (on the [!DNL Pencil] tab) so your feature line adheres to the mask edges for this object. You can choose to leave [!DNL Snap To Mask Edges] on Always, or only when you hold down the Shift key. You can also specify how close (in pixels) the cursor must be to the defined mask edge in order to snap to it. 

1. Hold down the mouse button and draw the feature as accurately as you can.
1. Release the mouse button when the feature is complete.
1. To smooth the feature (to adjust for any jerkiness in the drawing), drag the [!DNL Smoothing] slider (on the [!DNL Pencil] tab) to the right.

   Once you create a feature, you can hold down the Shift key and draw to add to that feature.
