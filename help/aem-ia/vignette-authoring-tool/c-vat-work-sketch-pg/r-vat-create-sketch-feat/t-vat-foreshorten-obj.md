# Adjusting the Preview for a Foreshortened Object{#adjusting-the-preview-for-a-foreshortened-object}

If the selected object appears foreshortened in the photograph, you can adjust the texture for the foreshortening with the Texture tool.

For example, if a sleeve is extended towards the camera, as in the photo below.

**To Adjust the Preview Texture for a Foreshortened Object:** 

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Sketch Page]** button ![](assets/sketch_button.png) to see the [!DNL Sketch] page (if it isn't already displayed).
1. Make sure the foreshortened object is selected in the [ [!DNL Select Object] box](../../c-vat-gs/c-vat-sel-obj/c-vat-sel-object-box.md#concept-d127c6efaabd436a96c02f36a7bce6ac).
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Texture]** tool ![](assets/texture.png).
