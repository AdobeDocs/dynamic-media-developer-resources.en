# Changing the Texture Origin and Size{#changing-the-texture-origin-and-size}

Define the texture origin and change the texture scale on the Sketch page with the Texture tool.

You can also [choose a different preview texture](../../c-vat-flow-pg/c-vat-test-flow-work/t-vat-prev-text.md#task-ae35e07a54de4eebb9c17721f54e1132).

The texture origin appears as a red box: ![](assets/red_box.png)

In general, you should control texture alignment across adjacent objects by using an [ [!DNL Object Connector]](../../c-vat-work-sketch-pg/r-vat-create-sketch-feat/r-vat-create-sketch-feat.md#reference-b7085135ac07423293bf9014bfebf461) feature. If the current object contains an [!DNL Object Connector] feature, you may not have to use the [!DNL Texture] tool. Doing so can undo your [!DNL Object Connector] feature work.

If the selected object appears foreshortened in the photograph, you can also [adjust the texture for the foreshortening](../../c-vat-work-sketch-pg/r-vat-create-sketch-feat/t-vat-foreshorten-obj.md#task-f97edf6400b043cbb6d02ce56ac39edd) with the [!DNL Texture] tool. For example, if a sleeve is extended towards the camera.

**To Adjust the Texture Origin and Size:** 

1. On the [!DNL Sketch] page, make sure the object you want is selected in the [ [!DNL Select Object] box](../../c-vat-gs/c-vat-sel-obj/c-vat-sel-object-box.md#concept-d127c6efaabd436a96c02f36a7bce6ac).
1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Texture]** tool ![](assets/texture.png).
1. To change the texture origin, do any of the following:

    * Drag the origin to a new location. 
    * Double-click where you want the origin. 
    * Type new values in the [!DNL Origin] fields.

1. To center the origin on the object, click the **[!UICONTROL Center Origin]** button.
1. To change the texture size, type new values in the [!DNL Overall Size] fields.

   Larger values make the pattern smaller, and vice versa. 

1. To change the resolution for the texture, select a feature line and type the actual length of the selected feature in the [!DNL Selected Feature Length] field.

   The pointer changes to an exclamation point when you position the mouse over the selected feature.
