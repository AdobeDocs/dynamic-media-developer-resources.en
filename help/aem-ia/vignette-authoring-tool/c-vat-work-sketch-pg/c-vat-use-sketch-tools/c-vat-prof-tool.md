# The Profile Tool{#the-profile-tool}

Because sketch features are three-dimensional, each feature has a width and height, as well as a length.

When you create a feature, you drag it out to specify its length. The default width and height are determined by the feature type you chose. You can adjust the width and height of [!DNL Folds], [!DNL Ridges], [!DNL Horizon Edges], and [!DNL Object Connectors] with the [!DNL Profile] tool.

You can adjust the width of a feature by selecting and dragging the small squares that appear on the feature when this tool is selected. To make the entire feature wider, drag the profile edge (indicated by a dashed red line) away from the centerline. If you hold down the Shift key as you do this, the width increases by a constant amount at each point along the centerline. If you don't hold down the Shift key as you drag, any zero-width regions (for example, the areas around the end points) remain at zero width.

The [!DNL Profile] tool has the following options:

* **Delete Profile:** Deletes the current profile handle. You can also press the **[!UICONTROL Del]**key to delete the currently selected handle. 

* **Height/Width Ratio:** Lets you change the ratio of width to height. This affects the overall steepness of the feature. You cannot adjust the height directly. 
* **Feature Width Taper:** Causes the ends of the current feature to become gradually less steep. You can taper the start and end of the feature independently. You determine the start and end of a feature by the direction in which you draw the feature. 
* **Flip Feature:** Reverses the selected feature. 
* **Set Default Width:** Applies the current profile settings to new instances of all features that use profiles ( [!DNL Folds], [!DNL Ridges], [!DNL Horizon Edges], and [!DNL Object Connectors]). Subsequent features that use profiles will use the new width until you change it again and click this button or exit [!DNL Image Authoring] and restart it.
