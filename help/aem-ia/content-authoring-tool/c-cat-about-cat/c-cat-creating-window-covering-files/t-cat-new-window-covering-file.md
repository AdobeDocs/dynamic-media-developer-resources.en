# Creating a New Window Covering File{#creating-a-new-window-covering-file}

When you create a window covering file, you create an image that you can add to any Image Authoring vignette.

 **To Create a New Window Covering File: ** 

1. From the [!DNL Start] menu on your computer desktop, choose **[!UICONTROL Programs]** > **[!UICONTROL Scene7]** > **[!UICONTROL Image Authoring]** > **[!UICONTROL Content Authoring Tool]**.
1. In the [!DNL Content Authoring] tool, choose **[!UICONTROL File]** > **[!UICONTROL Open]**.
1. In the [!DNL Open] dialog box, select the [!DNL .vnw] file you exported from [!DNL Image Authoring], then click **[!UICONTROL OK]**.

   If you created a pair of left- and right-hand images, start with the left-hand one. If you created both a narrow and a wide image, start with the narrow one. 

1. Specify the style for this window covering.

   From the first pull-down list, select the type of window covering you are creating. Depending on your selection, the second pull-down list displays [!DNL Narrow] or [!DNL Left]. 

1. Do one of the following:

    * If the second pull-down list initially displayed [!DNL Left] , choose [!DNL Right].

      A **[!UICONTROL Load]** button appears next to the pull-down list. Click it and select the right-hand image. 
    
    * If the second pull-down list initially displayed [!DNL Narrow] , and if you saved a wide version of this window covering, choose **[!UICONTROL Wide]**.

      A **[!UICONTROL Load]** button appears next to the pull-down list. Click it and select the wide image.

1. Make adjustments as needed.

   Generally, the main adjustments you should make are on the [Illumination](../../c-cat-about-cat/c-cat-creating-window-covering-files/c-cat-adjust-window-covering-file.md#concept-5a7322fccc4d4fc89c2b5c3230ecc606) tab, where you specify the thickness of the window covering and its resolution, and on the [Opacity](../../c-cat-about-cat/c-cat-creating-window-covering-files/c-cat-adjust-window-covering-file.md#concept-5a7322fccc4d4fc89c2b5c3230ecc606) tab where you can import a file specifying the opacity of the window covering. 

1. Choose **[!UICONTROL File]** > **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
