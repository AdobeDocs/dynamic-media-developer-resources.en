# About Window Coverings{#about-window-coverings}

Use the Content Authoring tool to create window-covering images as separate objects you can import and apply in Image Authoring.

For example, you can create a set of drapes or a shade, then add that window covering to a window or windows in any photographic image in [!DNL Image Authoring].

Window-covering images that you create in the [!DNL Content Authoring] tool can accept textures and colors.
