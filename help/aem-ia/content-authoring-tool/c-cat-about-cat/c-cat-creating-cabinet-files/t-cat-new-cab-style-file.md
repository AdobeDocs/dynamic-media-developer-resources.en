# Creating a New Cabinet Style File{#creating-a-new-cabinet-style-file}

When you create a cabinet style file, you create a set of images that are all saved in a single file.

The images can include vertical and horizontal sections, doors for left- and right-hand wall and base cabinet doors, cabinet doors with glass panels, and drawers.

1. From the [!DNL Start] menu on your computer desktop, choose **[!UICONTROL Programs]** > **[!UICONTROL Scene7]** > **[!UICONTROL Image Authoring]** > **[!UICONTROL Content Authoring Tool]**.
1. In the [!DNL Content Authoring Tool], choose **[!UICONTROL File]** > **[!UICONTROL New]**.
1. In the [!DNL New] dialog box, select [!DNL Cabinet Style], then click **[!UICONTROL OK]**.
