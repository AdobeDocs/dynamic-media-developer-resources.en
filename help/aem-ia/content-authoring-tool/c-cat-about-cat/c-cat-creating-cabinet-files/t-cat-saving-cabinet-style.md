# Saving Your Cabinet Style{#saving-your-cabinet-style}

Scene7 recommends that you save your cabinet style in PNG format, as this is the least lossy choice.

If you upload a large number of cabinet styles to a server, and load time or disk space is an issue, you can choose a smaller format.

**To Save Your Cabinet Style:** 

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Save]** icon on the toolbar.

   Do not choose [!DNL Save] from the [!DNL File] menu, as it does not let you specify a file format. 

1. Choose a format for your cabinet style.

   This file format is used for the images that comprise your cabinet style. Then, the entire set of images is saved in a single [!DNL .vnc] file. 

1. Specify a size for the thumbnail images.

   Thumbnails of your cabinet images are saved in the same folder as your [!DNL .vnc] file. You can use these thumbnails as buttons on your website, to show customers their cabinet choices. 

1. Specify the save version.

   The save version determines which versions of the [!DNL Image Rendering] software can interpret your cabinet styles. This version number should match the version of your I [!DNL mage Rendering] software. To check the version number, choose **[!UICONTROL Help]** > **[!UICONTROL About in Image Authoring]** and check the [!DNL VNT File Version]. 

1. Click **[!UICONTROL OK]**.
1. Specify a name and location for the cabinet style file, then click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
