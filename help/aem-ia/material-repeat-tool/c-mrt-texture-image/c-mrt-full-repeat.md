# Identifying the Full Repeat{#identifying-the-full-repeat}

The term full repeat is commonly used in the wall covering and fabric industries.

This space can vary in size style and color but it is always rectangular.

The [!DNL Material Repeat] tool deals with two types of repeats, half-drop and half-across:

* Half-drop repeat

  pushes the first fully visible row of fill textures *down* halfway. This can be useful when a border covering the fill texture is half the size of the texture. 
* Half-across repeat

  Pushes the first fully visible row of fill textures *across* halfway. This can be useful when a texture imitates a brick pattern, with the bricks overlapping by half their width.

A full repeat lets you accurately offset the image to repeat both horizontally and vertically without a seam line. You can then use this full repeat as the sample fabric for rendering in [!DNL Image Authoring].

Start by visually identifying the repeat on your texture sample, then [scanning](../c-mrt-texture-image/c-mrt-pattern-full-repeat.md#concept-f7a4e82c3378466cba9d2760047ab3a8) or [photographing](../c-mrt-texture-image/c-mrt-texture-images-dig-camera.md#concept-7af56d7a19c34966aa9b61b304306c6d) the repeat.
