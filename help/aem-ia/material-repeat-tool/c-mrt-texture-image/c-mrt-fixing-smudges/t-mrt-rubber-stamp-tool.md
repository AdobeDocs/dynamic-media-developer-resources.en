# To Adjust the Opacity for the Rubber Stamp Tool{#to-adjust-the-opacity-for-the-rubber-stamp-tool}

1. Select the [!DNL Rubber Stamp] tool from the toolbar.
1. Go to **[!UICONTROL Window]** > **[!UICONTROL Show Options]**.
1. Adjust the tool to stamp at 100%.
Use a soft brush to blend into a seamed area that may require more delicacy. The brush size you use depends on the size and area you are modifying. Smaller brushes are usually more useful for patching smaller areas.
