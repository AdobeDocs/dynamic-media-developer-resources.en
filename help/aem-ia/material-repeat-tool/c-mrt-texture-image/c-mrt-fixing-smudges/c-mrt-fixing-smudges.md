# Fixing Smudges, Tears, Spots, and Holes{#fixing-smudges-tears-spots-and-holes}

Use the Rubber Stamp tool in Photoshop to fix smudges, tears, spots, holes, and the like before using the Material Repeat tool .

The [!DNL Rubber Stamp] paints one part of a canvas to match another part. This works better than cut and paste, because it lets you choose the ideal brush size for your specific patch job. Use an [!DNL Opacity] setting of 100% to get a full spot sample and an accurate replication.
