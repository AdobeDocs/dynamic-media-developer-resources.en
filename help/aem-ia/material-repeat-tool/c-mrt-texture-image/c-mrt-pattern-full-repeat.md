# Scanning the Pattern for the Full Repeat{#scanning-the-pattern-for-the-full-repeat}

If your image fits on a scanner bed, follow these recommendations to achieve the best scanning results.

If the image does not fit on a scanner bed, [use a digital camera](../c-mrt-texture-image/c-mrt-texture-images-dig-camera.md#concept-7af56d7a19c34966aa9b61b304306c6d) to capture it.

** General**

* Pre-scan the image you want to use for your full repeat. 
* Make sure that the image is straight on the scanner bed, not wrinkled or folded. 
* Scan the image slightly larger than the repeat on the fabric/wallpaper, so you have plenty of room to skew, transform, or move the fabric. 
* Be sure the fabric has both a horizontal and a vertical repeat. 
* A square repeat is the only way to ensure that the fabric tiles out properly.

**Screen Resolution**

* If the repeat on a fabric or wall covering is smaller than Â½ inch, or if the fabric or wallpaper is highly textured, scan it at 68 ppi to help identify the object in the scan. 
* For objects with a small repeat or a fine texture, use a higher resolution scan for greater clarity. 
* For all other images, scan at 34 ppi.

**Canvas size**

* The final full-tile repeat should be one full repeat horizontally and vertically. 
* If your pattern is very small, however, you must capture multiple repeats. As a rule of thumb, make your full-tile repeat approximately one foot square.
