# Creating a Full-Tile Repeat{#creating-a-full-tile-repeat}

If you want to create a texture file for use with Image Authoring, and that texture has a repeating pattern, you must create a texture file that constitutes a full-tile repeat.

When the texture file is tiled, or repeatedly rendered on an object, all the edges of the pattern join seamlessly.
