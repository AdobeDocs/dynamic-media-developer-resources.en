# Creating the Final Repeat{#creating-the-final-repeat}

The Lighting tab lets you view multiple tiles to make sure that the pattern repeats properly.

 ** To Create the Final Repeat:** 

1. Check the [!DNL Highlight Tile Edges] checkbox to see how the pattern tiles.
1. Uncheck [!DNL Highlight Tile Edges], then zoom in to check the corners of the repeat.
1. If the repeated items in the pattern don't match at the corners, use the [!DNL Perspective] tab to redefine the edges of the repeat.
1. If a gradient is apparent in the tiled pattern, use the [!DNL Lighting] tab to correct it.
1. When the repeat is final, click the **[!UICONTROL Finish]** button on the [!DNL Lighting] tab.

   The [!DNL Material Repeat] tool saves your changes to the image file and closes, leaving the image open in [!DNL Photoshop].
