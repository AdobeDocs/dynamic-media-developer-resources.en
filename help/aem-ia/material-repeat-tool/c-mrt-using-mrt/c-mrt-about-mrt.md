# About the Material Repeat Tool{#about-the-material-repeat-tool}

The Material Repeat tool is a Photoshop plug-in you can use to create a full-tile repeat.

If you have [!DNL Photoshop], the [!DNL Material Repeat] tool is installed when you install [!DNL Image Authoring]. The [!DNL Material Repeat] tool can help you do the following:

* [Adjust for perspective distortion:](../c-mrt-using-mrt/t-mrt-perspective-tab.md#task-2ca7a919dc134ecda15761ed75c9eb7c) when the sample was not photographed parallel to the camera's image plane and, as a result, parallel lines in the sample are not parallel in the image. 
* [Remove gradients caused by uneven lighting:](../c-mrt-using-mrt/t-mrt-lighting-tab.md#task-b98244d3adf24bd180a7b82d2f177359) when illumination varies across the image and, as a result, the opposite edges of the image don't match in brightness or saturation. 
* [Create a tile that uses a half-drop or half-across repeat](../c-mrt-using-mrt/t-mrt-final-repeat.md#task-0b9f8a2a321f4bd796142c8070f9bfc1).

The [!DNL Material Repeat] tool has its own **[!UICONTROL Zoom In]** and **[!UICONTROL Zoom Out]** buttons to control its display. You can [change some aspects](../c-mrt-using-mrt/t-mrt-changing-mrt-options.md#task-5902897eb7d04660822df27d2e24c0d8) of the appearance and behavior of the tool.
