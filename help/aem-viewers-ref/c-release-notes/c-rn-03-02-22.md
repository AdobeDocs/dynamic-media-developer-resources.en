## Adobe Customer Care {#customer-care}

See [Support](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/dynamic-media-classic/using/intro/support.html#intro).

## Known issues and restrictions {#known-issues-and-restrictions}

* The Image Serving modifiers from IS commands are not added to the `req=set` request by design. However, modifiers that only affect image display work fine. Modifiers affecting size must be used in a complex asset. 
* Scaling the browser window leads to incorrect resizing.
* iPad 2 - Large eCatalog assets crash Safari on iOS.

### All viewers {#all-viewers}

* Watermarks, obfuscation, and locking are not supported.
* Image presets are not supported.
* Adding or removing viewer from the DOM using `display:none` CSS or by dynamically detaching it from the parent node is not supported.

### HTML5 all viewers {#html5-all-viewers}

* Embedding a viewer in a table can result in incorrect sizing or placement of the viewer in non-native full-screen mode. Adobe recommends you use DIVs instead.
* Parameters with explicit instance names in the code require instance names in the URL as well to be overwritten (for example, `zoomView.iconfeffect=0`).
* Image Serving command `crop` is not supported.
* **[!UICONTROL Close]** button only works if the viewer is open in a child window.
* IS commands modifier does not support Image Serving modifiers that affect image size.

### HTML5 eCatalog {#html5-ecatalog}

* Navigating to other HTML page and then returning occasionally causes the viewer to reset back to the first page.
* Page layout occasionally displays incorrectly after rotating the iOS device. Zooming into the page corrects the layout.
* Internal links only to left-most page in multi-page spreads. Affects mobile devices in portrait mode.

### HTML5 Mixed Media {#html5-mixed-media}

* Soundtrack play is not supported.

### HTML5 Social {#html5-social}

* To render thumbnails properly in outgoing email, the `serverurl` modifier must have an absolute URL.

### HTML5 Video {#html5-video}

* The poster image can encounter a `max size` error. Increase the limit setting for Image Serving Publish.
* Video captions require a company rule set if the hosting HTML page is served from an external server (not a Dynamic Media server). Contact [Adobe Customer Care](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/dynamic-media-classic/using/intro/support.html#intro) for assistance.
* Analytics tracking can report incorrect play percentage due to buffering.
* On iPad or Android&trade; devices, a black frame shows instead of a poster image.
* On iPad or Android&trade; devices, a black frame flashes onscreen during the loading of the viewer.
* On iPad devices, black borders are shown on the side of the VideoPlayer component when the background is set to white/transparent.
* On iPad, using iOS 7, the last frame of video is distorted.
* On Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer browsers, occasional macro blocking occurs during video seek in HLS streaming mode.
* The poster image does not show in the Microsoft&reg; Edge browser for visitors the first time.
* When progressive playback is used, the poster image hides after the video loads in Internet Explorer 9.
