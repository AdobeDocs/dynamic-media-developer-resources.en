# Scene7 Viewers 5.0.1 Release Notes{#scene-viewers-release-notes}

## Adobe Scene7 Viewers {#section-0b0363fae0274737bace119f281e740f}

Viewer upgrades are backwards compatible and therefore, no changes are necessary to your existing web code. However, it is recommended that you test the new viewers on our staging environment. The following website gives instructions on how you can set up your system to access our staging server:

[https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/scene7/kb/base/upgrade-management/testing-scene7-viewers-upgrade.html](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/scene7/kb/base/upgrade-management/testing-scene7-viewers-upgrade.html)

After you have set up your computer to access the staging server, you can check your website to test the upgrade. For customers using out-of-the-box viewers, best practice is for you to test against our standard staging server and s7is1-preview-staging.scene7.com.

## Known issues and restrictions {#section-368dd0dc138b44e28b49314e4ad0fa1a}

**All Scene7 viewers**

* Watermarks, obfuscation, and locking are not supported.

**All viewers**

* Embedding viewer in table may result in incorrect sizing or placement of viewer in non-native fullscreen mode. Suggest using DIVs instead. 
* Parameters with explicit instance names in the code must be overwritten; instance names in a URL must also be overwritten. For example, `zoomView.iconeffect=0`. 
* Image Serving command crop is not supported. 
* Close button only works if the viewer is open in a child window.

**Adobe Analytics Training**

* When using Scene7 viewers with Adobe Analytics tracking based on s_code.jsp, "page" requests are sent rather than "track‚Äù requests for all tracked events. This results in over-inflated page view metrics for pages that contain a Scene7 viewer. To fix this issue, copy the contents of AppMeasurementBridge.jsp to a Javascript file to be served with the viewer page. In the resultant Javascript replace all calls to s.t() with s.tl() for all events other than LOAD event. This issue does not impact Scene7 video viewers using the new Adobe Analytics Video Heartbeat reporting. 
* Internet Explorer: "Access is denied" JavaScript error occurs using SSL / HTTPS with Adobe Analytics tracking enabled.

**eCatalog viewer**

* JavaScript templates in image maps are not supported. 
* Navigating to another HTML page and then returning occasionally causes the viewer to reset back to the first page. 
* Set `ImageMapEffect` rollover modifier to `1` to invoke infopanels. 

* `Frametransition` set to `none` or `fade` is not supported. 

* Page layout occasionally displays incorrectly after rotating the iOS device. Zoom into page corrects layout. 
* Internal links only to leftmost page in multi-page spreads. Affects mobile devices in portrait mode. 
* InitalFrame links only to leftmost page in multi-page spreads. Affects mobile devices in portrait mode.

**Mixed Media viewer**

* Sound track play is not supported at this time.

**Social viewer**

* To render thumbnails properly in outgoing email the `serverurl` modifier should have an absolute URL.

**Video viewer**

* The poster image may encounter "max size" error. The user may need to increase the limit setting for Image Serving Publish. 
* Video captions require a company ruleset if they are hosting an HTML page that is served from an external server that is not a Scene7 server. Contact Adobe technical support for assistance. 
* Analytics tracking may report incorrect play percentage due to buffering 
* Black frame instead of poster image may show on iPad or Android devices. 
* Black frame may flash on screen during viewer load on iPad or Android devices.
