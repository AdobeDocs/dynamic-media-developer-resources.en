# setContainerId{#setcontainerid}

JavaScript API reference for Video Viewer.

 ` setContainerId( *`containerId`*)`

Sets the ID of the DOM container (normally a DIV) into which the viewer is inserted. It is not necessary to have the container element created by the time this method is called. However, the container must exist when `init()` is run. It must be called before `init()`.

This method is optional if the viewer configuration information was passed with `config` JSON object to constructor.
