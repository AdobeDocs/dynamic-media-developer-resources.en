>[!NOTE]
>
>This button supports the `state` attribute selector, which can be used to apply different skins to different button states.

It is possible to remove the button from the Social share panel by setting `display:none` CSS property on its CSS class.

The button tool tip can be localized. See [Localization of user interface elements](../../../c-html5-s7-aem-asset-viewers/c-html5-ecatsearch-viewer-about/c-html5-ecatsearch-viewer-localization.md#concept-cbfc39344c494eb7b9f6a272cff0cc74) for more information.

Example - to set up a Facebook share button that is 28 x 28 pixels, and displays a different image for each of the four different button states:

```
.s7ecatalogsearchviewer .s7facebookshare { 
 width:28px; 
 height:28px; 
} 
.s7ecatalogsearchviewer .s7facebookshare[state='up'] { 
background-image:url(images/v2/FacebookShare_dark_up.png); 
} 
.s7ecatalogsearchviewer .s7facebookshare[state='over'] { 
background-image:url(images/v2/FacebookShare_dark_over.png); 
} 
.s7ecatalogsearchviewer .s7facebookshare[state='down'] { 
background-image:url(images/v2/FacebookShare_dark_down.png); 
} 
.s7ecatalogsearchviewer .s7facebookshare[state='disabled'] { 
background-image:url(images/v2/FacebookShare_dark_disabled.png); 
}
```
