Flyout Viewer is an image viewer. It displays a static image with the zoomed version shown in the flyout view that a user activates. This viewer works with image sets and navigation is done by using swatches. It is designed to work on desktops and mobile devices.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Images which use IR (Image Rendering) or UGC (User-Generated Content) are not supported by this viewer.

Viewer type is 504.

See [System requirements and prerequisites](../../c-system-requirements-and-prerequisites.md#concept-9282e5b777de42cdaf72ef7ebd646842).

## Using Flyout Viewer {#section-f21ac23d3f6449ad9765588d69584772}

Flyout Viewer represents a main JavaScript file and a set of helper files (a single JavaScript include with all Viewer SDK components used by this particular viewer, assets, CSS) downloaded by the viewer in runtime

Flyout Viewer is only intended for embedded use, which means that it is integrated into the web page using documented API. No production-ready web page is available for the Flyout Viewer.

Configuration and skinning are similar to that of the other viewers. You can use custom CSS to apply skinning.

See [Command reference common to all viewers - Configuration attributes](../../r-html5-viewer-20-cmdref-configattrib/r-html5-viewer-20-cmdref-configattrib.md#concept-850e0f2c49b949deb7cfbfd330d329bd) and [Command reference common to all Viewers - URL](../../c-html5-viewer-20-cmdref-url/c-html5-viewer-20-cmdref-url.md#concept-9b337f349b7b406b8c33c7ee96b3e226)

## Interacting with Flyout Viewer {#section-ab66eb6955aa4a8aa6d14a3b3acfed3f}

Flyout Viewer supports single-touch and multi-touch gestures that are common in other mobile applications.

   <td colname="col2"> <p>If the gesture is done within the swatches area, it performs a native page scroll. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>

The viewer also supports both touch input and mouse input on Windows devices with touch screen and mouse. This support, however, is limited to Chrome, Internet Explorer 11, and Edge web browsers only.

This viewer is fully keyboard accessible.

## Embedding Flyout Viewer {#section-6bb5d3c502544ad18a58eafe12a13435}

Different web pages have different needs for viewer behavior. The web page may have static page layout, or use responsive design that displays differently on different devices, or for different browser window sizes. To accommodate these needs, the viewer supports two primary operation modes: fixed size embedding and responsive design embedding.

Fixed size embedding mode is used when the viewer does not change its size after its initial load. This choice is best for web pages that have a static page layout.

Responsive design embedding mode assumes that the viewer may need to resize during runtime in response to the size change of its container `DIV`. The most common use case is adding a viewer to a web page that uses a flexible page layout.

When using responsive design embedding mode with the Flyout Viewer, make sure that you specify explicit breakpoints for the main view image using the `imagereload` parameter. Ideally, match your breakpoints with the viewer width breakpoints as dictated by the web page CSS.

In responsive design embedding mode the viewer behaves differently depending on the way a web page sizes its container `DIV`. If the web page sets only the width of the container `DIV`, leaving its height unrestricted, then the viewer automatically chooses its height according to the aspect ratio of the asset that is used. This means that the asset fits perfectly into the view without any padding on the sides. This particular use case is the most common for web pages that use responsive design layout frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, and so forth.

Otherwise, if the web page sets both the width and the height for the viewer's container `DIV`, then the viewer fills only that area and follows the size provided by the web page layout. A good use case example is embedding the viewer into a modal overlay, where the overlay is sized according to web browser window size.

**Fixed size embedding**

You add the viewer to a web page by doing the following:

1. Adding the viewer JavaScript file to your web page. 
1. Defining the container `DIV`. 
1. Setting the viewer size. 
1. Creating and initializing the viewer.

1. Adding the viewer JavaScript file to your web page.

   Creating a viewer requires that you add a script tag in the HTML head. Before you can use the viewer API, be sure that you include `FlyoutViewer.js`. `FlyoutViewer.js` is located in the following [!DNL html5/js/] subfolder of your standard IS-Viewers deployment:

[!DNL <s7viewers_root>/html5/js/FlyoutViewer.js]

   You can use a relative path if the viewer is deployed on one of the Adobe Dynamic Media servers and it is served from the same domain. Otherwise, you specify a full path to one of Adobe Dynamic Media servers that have the IS-Viewers installed.

   A relative path looks like the following:

   ```
   <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="/s7viewers/html5/js/FlyoutViewer.js"></script>
   ```

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >You should only reference the main viewer JavaScript `include` file on your page. You should not reference any additional JavaScript files in the web page code which might be downloaded by the viewer's logic in runtime. In particular, do not directly reference HTML5 SDK `Utils.js` library loaded by the viewer from `/s7viewers` context path (so-called consolidated SDK `include`). The reason is that the location of `Utils.js` or similar runtime viewer libraries is fully managed by the viewer's logic and the location changes between viewer releases. Adobe does not keep older versions of secondary viewer `includes` on the server. 
   >
   >
   >As a result, putting a direct reference to any secondary JavaScript `include` used by the viewer on the page breaks the viewer functionality in the future when a new product version is deployed.

1. Defining the container DIV.

   Add an empty DIV element to the page where you want the viewer to appear. The DIV element must have its ID defined because this ID is later passed to the viewer API.

   The placeholder DIV is a positioned element, meaning that the `position` CSS property is set to `relative` or `absolute`.

   It is the responsibility of the web page to specify the proper `z-index` for the placeholder DIV element. Doing so ensures that the viewerâ€™s flyout portion appears on top of the other web page elements.

   The following is an example of a defined placeholder DIV element:

   ```
   <div id="s7viewer" style="position:relative;z-index:1"></div> 
   
   ```

1. Setting the viewer size.

   This viewer displays thumbnails when working with multi-item sets. On desktop systems, thumbnails are placed below the main view. At the same time, the viewer allows the swapping of the main asset during runtime using `setAsset()` API. As a developer, you have control over how the viewer manages the thumbnails area in the bottom area when the new asset has only one item. It is possible to keep the outer viewer size intact and let the main view increase its height and occupy the thumbnails area. Or, you can keep the main view size static and collapse the outer viewer area, thereby letting web page content to move up, and then use the free page real estate left from the thumbnails.

   To keep the outer viewer bounds intact define the size for `.s7flyoutviewer` top-level CSS class in absolute units. Sizing in CSS can be put right on the HTML page, or in a custom viewer CSS file, which is later assigned to a viewer preset record in Dynamic Media Classic, or passed explicitly using style command.

   See [Customizing Flyout Viewer](../../c-html5-s7-aem-asset-viewers/c-html5-flyout-viewer-20-about/c-html5-flyout-viewer-20-customizingviewer/c-html5-flyout-viewer-20-customizingviewer.md#concept-82f8c71adbe54680a0c2f83f81e5f451) for more information about styling the viewer with CSS.

   The following is an example of defining the static outer viewer size in an HTML page:

   ```
   #s7viewer.s7flyoutviewer { 
    width: 640px; 
    height: 480px; 
   }
   ```

   You can see the behavior with a fixed outer viewer area on the following sample page. Notice that when you switch between sets, the outer viewer size does not change:

   [https://experienceleague.adobe.com/tools/dynamic-media-demo/viewers-ref/flyout/FlyoutViewer-fixed-outer-area.html](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/tools/dynamic-media-demo/viewers-ref/flyout/FlyoutViewer-fixed-outer-area.html)

   To make the main view dimensions static, define the viewer size in absolute units for the inner `Container` SDK component using `.s7flyoutviewer .s7container` CSS selector. In addition, you should override the fixed size defined for the `.s7flyoutviewer` top-level CSS class in the default viewer CSS, by setting it to `auto`.

   The following is an example of defining the viewer size for the inner `Container` SDK component so that the main view area does not change its size when switching the asset:

   ```
   #s7viewer.s7flyoutviewer { 
    width: auto; 
    height: auto; 
   }  
   #s7viewer.s7flyoutviewer .s7container { 
    width: 640px; 
    height: 480px; 
   }
   ```

   The following sample page shows viewer behavior with a fixed main view size. Notice that when you switch between sets, the main view remains static and the web page content moves vertically:

   [https://experienceleague.adobe.com/tools/dynamic-media-demo/viewers-ref/flyout/FlyoutViewer-fixed-main-view.html](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/tools/dynamic-media-demo/viewers-ref/flyout/FlyoutViewer-fixed-main-view.html)

   Also, note that the default viewer CSS provides a fixed size for its outer area out-of-the-box. 

1. Creating and initializing the viewer.

   When you have completed the steps above, you create an instance of `s7viewers.FlyoutViewer` class, pass all configuration information to its constructor and call `init()` method on a viewer instance. Configuration information is passed to the constructor as a JSON object. At minimum, this object should have the `containerId` field which holds the name of viewer container ID and nested `params` JSON object with configuration parameters that the viewer supports. In this case, the `params` object must have at least the Image Serving URL passed as `serverUrl` property, and the initial asset as `asset` parameter. JSON-based initialization API lets you create and start the viewer with single line of code.

   It is important to have the viewer container added to the DOMso that the viewer code can find the container element by its ID. Some browsers delay building DOM until the end of the web page. For maximum compatibility, call the `init()` method just before the closing `BODY` tag, or on the body `onload()` event.

   At the same time, the container element should not necessarily be part of the web page layout just yet. For example, it may be hidden using `display:none` style assigned to it. In this case, the viewer delays its initialization process until the moment when the web page brings the container element back to the layout. When this happens, the viewer load automatically resumes.

   The following is an example of creating a viewer instance, passing the minimum necessary configuration options to the constructor and calling the `init()` method. The example assumes `flyoutViewer` is the viewer instance; `s7viewer` is the name of placeholder `DIV`; `http://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/` is the Image Serving URL; and `Scene7SharedAssets/ImageSet-Views-Sample` is the asset:

   ```
   <script type="text/javascript"> 
   var flyoutViewer = new s7viewers.FlyoutViewer({ 
    "containerId":"s7viewer", 
   "params":{ 
    "asset":"Scene7SharedAssets/ImageSet-Views-Sample", 
    "serverurl":"http://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/" 
   } 
   }).init(); 
   </script>
   ```

   The following code is a complete example of a trivial web page that embeds the Flyout Viewer with a fixed size:

   ```
   <!DOCTYPE html> 
   <html> 
   <head> 
   <script type="text/javascript" src="http://s7d1.scene7.com/s7viewers/html5/js/FlyoutViewer.js"></script> 
   <style type="text/css"> 
   #s7viewer.s7flyoutviewer { 
    width: 640px; 
    height: 480px; 
   } 
   </style> 
   </head> 
   <body> 
   <div id="s7viewer" style="position:relative;z-index:1;"></div> 
   <script type="text/javascript"> 
   var flyoutViewer = new s7viewers.FlyoutViewer({ 
    "containerId":"s7viewer", 
   "params":{ 
    "asset":"Scene7SharedAssets/ImageSet-Views-Sample", 
    "serverurl":"http://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/" 
   } 
   }).init(); 
   </script> 
   </body> 
   </html>
   ```

## Responsive design embedding with unrestricted height {#section-056cb574713c4d07be6d07cf3c598839}

With responsive design embedding, the web page normally has some kind of flexible layout in place that dictates the runtime size of the viewer's container `DIV`. For the following example, assume that the web page allows the viewer's container `DIV` to take 40% of the web browser window size, leaving its height unrestricted. The web page HTML code would look like the following:

```
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html> 
<head> 
<style type="text/css"> 
.holder { 
 width: 40%; 
} 
</style> 
</head> 
<body> 
<div class="holder"></div> 
</body> 
</html>
```

Adding the viewer to such a page is similar to the steps for fixed size embedding. The only difference is that you need to override the fixed sizing from the default viewer CSS with the size set in relative units.

1. Adding the viewer JavaScript file to your web page. 
1. Defining the container `DIV`. 
1. Setting the viewer size. 
1. Creating and initializing the viewer.

All the steps above are the same as with the fixed size embedding with the following three exceptions:

* add the container `DIV` to the existing "holder" `DIV`; 
* added `imagereload` parameter with explicit breakpoints; 
* instead of setting a fixed viewer size using absolute units use CSS that sets the viewer width and height to 100% as in the following:

```
#s7viewer.s7flyoutviewer { 
 width: 100%; 
 height: 100%; 
}
```

The following code is a complete example. Notice how the viewer size changes when the browser is resized, and how the viewer aspect ratio matches the asset.

```
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html> 
<head> 
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://s7d1.scene7.com/s7viewers/html5/js/FlyoutViewer.js"></script> 
<style type="text/css"> 
.holder { 
 width: 40%; 
} 
#s7viewer.s7flyoutviewer { 
 width: 100%; 
 height: 100%; 
} 
</style> 
</head> 
<body> 
<div class="holder"> 
<div id="s7viewer" style="position:relative;z-index:1"></div> 
</div> 
<script type="text/javascript"> 
var flyoutViewer = new s7viewers.FlyoutViewer({ 
 "containerId":"s7viewer", 
"params":{ 
 "asset":"Scene7SharedAssets/ImageSet-Views-Sample", 
 "serverurl":"http://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/", 
 "imagereload":"1,breakpoint,200;400;800;1600" 
} 
}).init(); 
</script> 
</body> 
</html>
```

The following examples page illustrates more real-life uses of responsive design embedding with unrestricted height:

## Flexible size embedding with width and height defined {#section-0a329016f9414d199039776645c693de}

In case of flexible-size embedding with width and height defined, the web page styling is different. It provides both sizes to the `"holder"` DIV and centers it in the browser window. Also, the web page sets the size of the `HTML` and `BODY` element to 100 percent.

```
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html> 
<head> 
<style type="text/css"> 
html, body { 
 width: 100%; 
 height: 100%; 
} 
.holder { 
 position: absolute; 
 left: 20%; 
 top: 20%; 
 width: 60%; 
height: 60%; 
} 
</style> 
</head> 
<body> 
<div class="holder"></div> 
</body> 
</html>
```

The rest of the embedding steps are identical to the steps used for responsive design embedding with unrestricted height. The resulting example is the following:

```
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html> 
<head> 
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://s7d1.scene7.com/s7viewers/html5/js/FlyoutViewer.js"></script> 
<style type="text/css"> 
html, body { 
 width: 100%; 
 height: 100%; 
} 
.holder { 
 position: absolute; 
 left: 20%; 
 top: 20%; 
 width: 60%; 
height: 60%; 
} 
#s7viewer.s7flyoutviewer { 
 width: 100%; 
 height: 100%; 
} 
</style> 
</head> 
<body> 
<div class="holder"> 
<div id="s7viewer" style="position:relative;z-index:1"></div> 
</div> 
<script type="text/javascript"> 
var flyoutViewer = new s7viewers.FlyoutViewer({ 
 "containerId":"s7viewer", 
"params":{ 
 "asset":"Scene7SharedAssets/ImageSet-Views-Sample", 
 "serverurl":"http://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/", 
 "imagereload":"1,breakpoint,200;400;800;1600" 
} 
}).init(); 
</script> 
</body> 
</html>
```

## Embedding using Setter-based API {#section-af26f0cc2e5140e8a9bfd0c6a841a6d1}

Instead of using JSON-based initialization, it is possible to use setter-based API and no-args constructor. Using this API constructor does not take any parameters and configuration parameters are specified using `setContainerId()`, `setParam()`, and `setAsset()` API methods, with separate JavaScript calls.

The following example illustrates using fixed size embedding with setter-based API:

```
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html> 
<head> 
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://s7d1.scene7.com/s7viewers/html5/js/FlyoutViewer.js"></script> 
<style type="text/css"> 
#s7viewer.s7flyoutviewer { 
 width: 640px; 
 height: 480px; 
} 
</style> 
</head><body> 
<div id="s7viewer" style="position:relative;z-index:1;"></div> 
<script type="text/javascript"> 
var flyoutViewer = new s7viewers.FlyoutViewer(); 
flyoutViewer.setContainerId("s7viewer"); 
flyoutViewer.setParam("serverurl", "http://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/"); 
flyoutViewer.setAsset("Scene7SharedAssets/ImageSet-Views-Sample"); 
flyoutViewer.init(); 
</script> 
</body> 
</html>
```
