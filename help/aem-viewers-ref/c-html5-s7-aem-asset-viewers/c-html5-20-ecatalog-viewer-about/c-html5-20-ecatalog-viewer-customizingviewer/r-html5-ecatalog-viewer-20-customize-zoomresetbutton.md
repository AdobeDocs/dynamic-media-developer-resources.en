>This button supports the `state` attribute selector, which can be used to apply different skins to different button states.

The button tool tip can be localized. See [Localization of user interface elements](../../../c-html5-s7-aem-asset-viewers/c-html5-20-ecatalog-viewer-about/c-html5-20-ecatalog-viewer-localization.md#concept-cbfc39344c494eb7b9f6a272cff0cc74) for more information.

Example - to set up a zoom reset button that is 28 x 28 pixels, positioned (on desktop) 4 pixels from the bottom and 47 pixels from the right edge of the main control bar, and displays a different image for each of the four different button states.

```
.s7ecatalogviewer .s7zoomresetbutton { 
bottom:4px; 
right:47px; 
width:28px; 
height:28px; 
} 
.s7ecatalogviewer .s7zoomresetbutton [state='up'] { 
background-image:url(images/v2/ZoomResetButton_dark_up.png); 
} 
.s7ecatalogviewer .s7zoomresetbutton [state='over'] {  
background-image:url(images/v2/ZoomResettButton_dark_over.png); 
} 
.s7ecatalogviewer .s7zoomresetbutton [state='down'] {

} 
.s7ecatalogviewer .s7zoomresetbutton [state='disabled'] {
