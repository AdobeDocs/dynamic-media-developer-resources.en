An end user can use the Favorites feature to mark products of interest directly in the e-catalog by adding "heart" icons to the e-catalog images. The viewer stores all the favorites on the client's system and displays them again when the same user visits the e-catalog again.

In addition, the viewer lets you review all favorites added to the e-catalog as a grid of thumbnail images.

All Favorites tools are grouped under one drop-down list in the control bar.
