# Control bar{#control-bar}

The control bar is the rectangular area that contains and sits behind all the UI controls available for the Smart Crop Video viewer, such as the play/pause button, volume controls, and so on.

<!--<a id="section_061E550C1C1D4DB2BD663A898895B38C"></a>-->

The control bar always takes the entire available viewer width. It is possible to change its color, height, and vertical position by CSS, relative to the Smart Crop Video viewer container.

The following CSS class selector controls the appearance of the control bar:

```
.s7smartcropvideoviewer .s7controlbar
```
