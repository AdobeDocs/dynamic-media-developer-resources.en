# full-screen support{#full-screen-support}

The viewer supports full-screen operation mode.

On modern desktop browsers, except Internet Explorer 10 and older, and on some touch devices, the viewer uses "native" full-screen mode. This mode means that the entire device screen is occupied by the viewer content.

On iOS devices and on older Internet Explorer browsers, the viewer uses "simulated" full-screen mode instead. In this mode, the viewer resizes to take the full area of the web browser window. Also, the web browser user interface and other windows are still visible on the screen.

A user enters and leaves full-screen mode by pressing the full-screen button in the viewer user interface. When "native" full-screen mode is used on desktop, it is also possible to exit it by pressing **Esc**.
