# Support for Adobe Analytics tracking{#support-for-adobe-analytics-tracking}

By default, the viewer sends a single tracking HTTP request to configured Image Server with viewer type and version information.

## Custom tracking {#section-cda48fc9730142d0bb3326bac7df3271}

In order to integrate with third-party analytics system it is necessary to listen to `trackEvent` viewer callback and process `eventInfo` argument of the callback function as necessary. The following code is an example of such handler function:

```javascript {.line-numbers}
var panoramicViewer = new s7viewers.PanoramicViewer({
	"containerId":"s7viewer",
"params":{
	"asset":"Scene7SharedAssets/PanoramicImage-Sample",
	"serverurl":"http://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/"
},
"handlers":{
	"trackEvent":function(objID, compClass, instName, timeStamp, eventInfo) {
		//identify event type
		var eventType = eventInfo.split(",")[0];
		switch (eventType) {
			case "LOAD":
				//custom event processing code
				break;
			//additional cases for other events
}
}
}
});

```

The viewer tracks the following SDK user events:

<table id="table_5D090E6614974D968E1A93B5727D859C"> 
 <thead> 
  <tr> 
   <th colname="col1" class="entry"> <p>SDK user event </p> </th> 
   <th colname="col2" class="entry"> <p>Sent... </p> </th> 
  </tr> 
 </thead>
 <tbody> 
  <tr> 
   <td colname="col1"> <p> <span class="codeph"> LOAD </span> </p> </td> 
   <td colname="col2"> <p>when viewer is loaded first. </p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody> 
</table>
