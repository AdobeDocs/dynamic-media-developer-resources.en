# emptyAssetsFromTrash{#emptyassetsfromtrash}

Empties assets from the IPS trash.

Assets live in the trash until they are manually emptied or until they time out of the trash. If they are manually emptied, they live in the Trash until the next cleanup job (normally nightly) when they are finally purged from the system. If they time out of the trash, assets are cleaned off as part of that same cleanup activity. The time out is configurable (defaults is 7 days).
