Image Production System API calls and their associated parameters that are no longer used.

## Deprecated calls {#topic-654c0466e6434fe4a95953322255b08c}

Image Production System API calls and their associated parameters that are no longer used.

* `addMediaPortalEvent` - Deprecated from Operations. This call let you add a Media Portal Event to IPS.  
* `getMediaPortalEvent` - Deprecated from Operations. This call let you get media portal events that matched specified criteria.  
* `getCdnCacheInvalidationStatus` - Deprecated from Operations. This API is now deprecated because the `cdnCacheInvalidation` API invalidates the cache almost immediately (~5 seconds). As such, polling for invalidation status is no longer required.
